It was a brutal couple of days.  When I arrived in Phoenix with a couple hours to kill, I decided to spend them with my dog, a book, and some wine, to unwind from the long drive.\n\nI walked into Grazie late on a Monday afternoon and stayed for about two hours.  The place was more or less empty, and I got a nice table on the patio all to myself.  It was a very hot day, and the patio wasn't quite comfortable, but it was as well covered and cool as it could be.  I drank two glasses of white wine from the extensive menu.  Both were quite good, and suited to the weather.\n\nIt was a mostly pleasant afternoon, but a couple things turned me off to Grazie.  One, while I was clearly not allowed inside with my dog (never expected, of course), the owner or someone on staff had two dogs inside the restaurant, roaming around.  At one point, the dogs came out, checked out my dog, and then one of them peed on the concrete wall right next my table, a foot away from where I was sitting.  Come on...I love dogs, but that's just gross.  Two, my second glass of wine came with a small surprise - I took one sip and pulled a dead bug from my tongue.  I pointed this out to my waiter, who did, to be fair, offer to replace the glass.  I thought it would be a shame to throw out the wine and I didn't mind drinking it, but I also kind of figured I might get that glass free, or get another glass thrown in.  I guess when I said I didn't want the wine to go to waste, the waiter decided that was that.\n\nThat said, the waiter was perfectly nice, and I had a good time drinking at Grazie.  I left with a light buzz, which was great for that time of day.  If I lived in town the dogs and the bug might still deter me from coming back, but I can't say I didn't enjoy my visit.", "business_id": "k6Si433-EJrY4J7SZxsnjA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-07-10", "type": "review"}

Located on South Highland where outdoor smokers and burning hickory alert the senses to something more than industrial surroundings Rollin Smoke is as small and homey as many a' Texas or Kansas City 'cue spots and staffed by Razorback pitmaster Trey Holland plus a dedicated team of enthusiasts the service is every bit on par with that down south - a true love of the art noted in lengthy answers to questions about woods, temperatures, and process while simultaneously making sure every guest is content.  Featuring a diverse menu with spices and rubs harkening the style of BBQ found across the south but a bit more aggressively sweet than that in Texas it was with a trio of smoked meats, two must-order sides, and buttery cornbread that I began and although brisket was a bit drier than I'd prefer the smoke was prominent and flavor was on point - a trend extending to fatty ribs and supple pulled pork that lacked not for juices, the latter falling just short of KC's Oklahoma Joe's reference standard.  Still nibbling at the creamy corn nuggets as plate two arrived it was here that I sampled Holland's two most raved items and with a blackened caramelized crust overlying tender flesh and melted collagen the beef rib wowed just as much as the signature meatloaf, absolutely rife with hickory notes and light heat amidst a delicately packed beef.  Ignoring decent but mundane chicken and mac n' cheese I found inedibly bland compared to the rich potatoes and previous fried sides it was with a duo of desserts that I rounded out the tasting and suffice it to say that while banana pudding tastes straight from a box the focus should instead be directed to the cobbler, a bubbling bowl of soft peaches with buttery pie crust crowned with Texas' own Blue Bell vanilla - a perfect end to a pretty damned good meal by any standard.", "business_id": "05fTEsjUPVo5jks8PpNKCQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-04-02", "type": "review"}

Salt of the Earth is in a great space.  There are two floors of dining areas and this combined with the high ceiling really opens up the dining room.  The downstairs dining area is very simple and comfortable, but it is also sleek and modern with a good use of blonde colored wood.  There is a great chalkboard on one wall, which lists up the menu (the menu seems to be very spontaneous with frequent changes).\n\nI really like the upstairs dining area because you get a great view of the downstairs dining area as well as the kitchen as they both cook and plate.\n\nThe menu features a lot of good ingredients with several interesting flavor combinations.  I started with the octopus, which was served with white bean puree, chorizo, crisp radishes, crunchy almonds, a cilantro pesto, and oranges.  The octopus was very nicely done.  It was incredibly soft and had a very interesting texture.  The octopus almost shredded like crab or braised meat.\n\nI did not like the chef's choice for the other ingredients on the plate though.  Everything was fine, but I was just not sure if all the flavors went together that well.  The white bean puree was also a little cold.\n\nNext came pork loin with a poached egg, farro and chorizo risotto, green tomato jam, pickled okra, and mustard seeds.  Like the octopus, the cooking of the pork was very good.  The pork was very tender and had a good amount of juiciness.  Once again, I was not a huge fan of all of the garnishes, which kept this dish from from being exceptional.  I also did not like the color of the dish.  Still, the plate definitely showed the talent in the kitchen.\n\nI did happen to see their ribeye special and salmon special and both dishes looked excellent.  The skin on the salmon looked crispy and flavorful while the ribeye had a great thickness and color.  The garnishes there also looked more traditional so those two dishes might have been better representations of what the Salt of the Earth kitchen can put out.\n\nFor dessert, I had zucchini bread, which came with crunchy sunflower seed brittle, rhubarb sauce, brown butter powder, and fennel ice cream.  The zucchini bread was good--nothing exceptional but good.  The brown butter powder was interesting and I really liked the fennel ice cream--good, unique flavor and very creamy.  It was not my favorite dessert, but like a lot of the dishes at Salt of the Earth, it really shows the potential of this restaurant.\n\nService was great--very personable and attentive.  The food came out at a quick pace.\n\nPrices were very reasonable given the high quality ingredients used and the generous portions.\n\nSalt of the Earth shows real potential.  There were definitely elements in each course that I really liked and I think if you order right here, you could probably have a very good meal.  There is definitely good sourcing of quality ingredients, a seasonal approach, talent in the kitchen, and a contemporary approach to the menu.  All of these pluses make Salt of the Earth one to consider for an upscale but still casual dinner in Pittsburgh (while I did not love Salt of the Earth, I would definitely give them another shot if I lived in Pittsburgh).\n\nYou can find metered parking on the street.", "business_id": "p1Wb4mEH04qrUMfmPepFzw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-11-24", "type": "review"}

In an effort to enjoy all that the city has to offer, I found myself here at Chang's one recent weekend afternoon, with the hope of scoring something delicious. What I had found was what I expected all along: an average run of the mill \"yum cha\" experience.\n\nIt's not entirely their fault, after all Las Vegas isn't overrun with a Chinatown that isn't filled with seedy adult joints and gringofied Chinese spots without the support or demand of a larger community. Hence, the exterior gives away the experience ahead of time: a semi-cheesy palatial looking front coupled with a retro sign that screams Chinese Americana from decades before.\n\nInside the Dim Sum scene is within the typical banquet hall, with a few carts that make their rounds, usually a couple with steamed dishes and the others with more fried pastries and desserts. Once we saw the same 4 carts that approached the table and very few staffers with special dishes to give out, the experience and variety is going to be limited.\n\nEverything from the steamed to the fried was bland. My beloved shrimp dumplings (har gow) needed some serious hot sauce before I could rip them from their mini bamboo baskets, even when the rice shell is dry and falling apart. The same could be applied to the fried pork dumplings (ham sui gok), which all of its glutinous glory was puffy and thick, but unfortunately was lacking on the pork part, skimpified on the guts side. All of the rice noodle wraps / crepes (cheurng fun) all needed some sweet soy sauce help before consumption, though the same can be said about the lo mai gai, siu mai, and fish + meat ball (ngau yuk yuen / lang yu kau).\n\nA surprisingly decent dish? The stir fried rice noodle with sesame seed. Soaked in soy sauce, topped with a sprinkling of sesame seed and peppers, it was surprisingly flavorful and light. It was fragrant and the texture was silky smooth. It piques my curiosity for their other non-cart noodle dishes. To no one's surprise, it falls in the special price column on the Dim Sum receipt.", "business_id": "5tYLVPc2PKnj6E62sY6QMg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-05-01", "type": "review"}

Buffet La Bonne Carte is pretty darn \"bon\" with a good variety of eclectic dishes that can be served a la carte or self-served at the buffet line.  In my opinion, it's the best place in the casino to get a good heaping of everything without sacrificing quality for reasonable prices.\n\nFor the budget conscious, coming here is practically a must.  The list of casino establishments are all too much at times - L'Entre Mise Deli is overpriced, simple food, Nuances is overpriced, gourmet food, and Via Fortuna doesn't do Italian any better than Olive Garden would in the states.  The Buffet's menu will change daily and the food is lavishly good during dinner and during my favorite time, brunch.\n\nA majority of the menu will be French and American inspired cuisine, and at a fixed price of $15.95 (lunch), $25.95 (dinner from Mon-Thurs) , $34.95 (dinner - Fri/Sat) and finally $19.95 (brunch).  My favorite time is brunch since the breakfast food is scrumptious with good presentation and generally available in all kinds of varieties.  Plus, if the party is here long enough, it'll transition into dinner time where the food is smashingly amazing.\n\nPlenty of locals will frequent this place and the lines will be past the elevators for the dinner showing on the weekends.  A gripe I would have is the customer service is nearly non-existent (since everything is self serve) and they serve no breakfast (opens at 11AM).\n\nThat's what the casino gets for not having a hotel.

Staff is smiling and prompt,  the fresh and large buffet selection awaits. Service was attentive, but as others have pointed out, silverware and napkins are out on the floor and need to be picked up separately. Minor irritation that there are plastic cups available for condiments by the prime rib station, but not by the cocktain sauce or tempura sauce stations- odd and a little inconvenient. Not to mention the soy sauce on the tables but no cups for that, either.\n\nHighlights include the make your own udon and dessert crepe sections, the veggie tempura spread, and of course- the seafood. No, the quality isn't what you'll find at the nicer AYCE places off-Strip, but the fish is super fresh and there is a small selection of sashimi, and the quality IS better than your average buffet. \n\nI really liked that there were about 12 rolls out on display, with labels. No confusion about what random roll I was eating, and the pieces weren't packed with tons of rice. I rather enjoyed that the pieces were cut small, so that I could try a bit of each rather than just a few before filling up.\nIn addition to sushi and sashimi, I also filled up on poke and shrimp cocktail, my usual buffet stand-by. Crab legs are also available at weekday dinner, but I did not partake.\n\nEDIT; two months later, I'm subtracting a star for lack of consistency. Raved about this place to a fish-loving friend and visited for lunch just after picking him up from the airport.

This is the fourth Ikea store I have visited (Pittsburgh PA, Schaumburg IL and Burbank CA) and they all have the same model: The upstairs is a large showroom with examples of their furniture set up in a multiple of configurations. The downstairs is a big showcase and shopping area where you can get everything from cutlery to flatware to pillows to drawer pulls. On a busy day, expect the winding route through both areas to take over an hour.\n\nCompletely separate from all of that is the food. Ikea offers a cafeteria style line that starts with desserts (of course!!) and then cold plates of salmon and shrimp, then a hot bar of baked salmon and those wonderful Swedish meatballs as well as steamed vegetables and not-packet mashed potatoes. It's North Carolina, of course, so I was not completely surprised to see fried chicken fingers and french fries offered. And finally, a small salad bar. Condiments are offered including BBQ sauce  if you absolutely have to have it.\n\nMy wife and I were hungry today, so we had a piece of the caramel cake with the meatballs and a piece of the salmon. Fountain sodas are available too, but don't miss the delicious lingonberry drink. Decaf coffee is there, but you have to hunt for it. There are a few signs up explaining why people should bus their own tables (to save money).\n\nAll of the food and more is available from the mini-market downstairs, which is located next to the snack shop (50 cent all beef hot dogs!). It's amazing how many different ways you can process a piece of salmon or herring. If you can find a method these Swedes haven't discovered, more power to ya!\n\nOkay, I lied about not reviewing the furniture. I agree that it's not hand built heirloom quality stuff. It's inexpensive, maybe even cheap. But the stuff stands up pretty well. We have a pair of bedside drawers that we bought in 2001 and they are as good now as they were then, despite moving homes four times. I expect they will last at least another ten years.

Last year I bought a USC Jersey (Grad School) and this past weekend I bought a UNLV Jersey (Undergrad).  Their selection of Jerseys is large and they carry unique items at this location that the others don't.  For example, last year this location was the only one that had a USC Football Jersey.  This weekend, while I was purchasing the UNLV Jersey the guy pointed out a USC dry-fit shirt that they just got in and said they were the only store to carry it.  So.....I bought it!  Dammit, I hate when that happens.....sales guy did his job!\n\nThere were a ton of other stuff too....they just got in the new Lakers gear, but I had to get out before I started spending too much money.  I love my sports teams and can easily get caught up with all the merchandise.  I paid quickly and ran out to my car.\n\nWill I return?

Nondescript from the exterior but cozy and kitsch inside as a friendly staff bounced between tables with endless refills of coffee from Illy at a mere $2.75 it was to a diverse menu and a hot, yeasty 'pot of bread' slathered with Nutella and toasted almonds that I arrived and after perusing the menu at length an order was placed, a server named Shirley warning me that it would be \"a lot of food,\" but failing to inform me of noted upcharges of $2 for a single Red Velvet Pancake and $1.25 for grits in place of potatoes.  Jovial in spirit with tunes ranging from Sinatra to Madonna playing overhead it was perhaps a ten minute wait after the bread that the rest of my meal arrived and with each item larger than expected in size it was indeed a substantial breakfast with only the cocoa-less Red Velvet failing to impress...the flavor merely that of a decent buttermilk pancake gussied up with $2 in dye.  Speaking to the rest, suffice it to say that it would be hard to mess up something as decadent as the signature \"S'Mores\" with ample chocolate chips and chocolate syrup finding balance in bold buttermilk, marshmallows, plus a dollop of whipped cream and yet as good as the pancake was, the un-fried riff on the Monte Cristo easily stole the show as golden Texas Toast dipped in custard housed Ham, Turkey, and Swiss of good quality and quantity, all just waiting for a sweet gilding of maple syrup to make flavors pop.  Never one to quibble prices but a firm believer that upcharges should always be disclosed Jamms strikes me as a good-enough place in a city with plenty of similar options; a bit better than some and a bit worse than others...the sort of place I'm sure to revisit at some point for the Waffle Sundae or the Stuffed French Toast, but not before investigating other family owned spots or before second visits to Blueberry Hill, Hash House, Egg & I, or Baby Stacks.", "business_id": "co0vxQ8ecXiBy2sGDeHi8A", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-02-10", "type": "review"}

For one, the appetizer and small plates weren't bad. Even the sushi was okay. They were quite empty when we were there so I was a little perplexed since it got rather good reviews on yelp.\n\nThe menu was large. Like in pretty damn big. We got some appetizers like soft shelled crabs, agedashi tofu, a few different types of sushi to try. I noticed they had tako-wasa, one of my favorite things to eat with beer, so we got that too. It wasn't bad. Actually none of the above items were bad.\n\nAfter grazing on appetizers we were debating whether to eat ramen here or move elsewhere. Hubby searched the reviews via cell and said that people liked the ramen. This is when we decided to order the pork bone ramen with extra chashu.\n\nWhen the bowl arrived, the steam indicated it was piping hot. I was excited. I took a sip of the broth, then another. I then moved the bowl over to hubby and asked him to taste the broth since he's pretty accepting of food -- much more than I.\n\nHe took a sip, then looked at me. Took another, then said \"it's watery\". My sentiments exactly. It was watery, flavorless and really subpar. But we didn't want to waste it, so I ate a few bites and my hubby bless his heart, ate the rest.\n\nFor a pork bone soup base, it failed miserably. There was no depth at all. Unlike some people, I thought the ramen at Ichiza was 100x better, unfortunately, Ichiza runs out of their broth really quickly so if you go later in the day they won't have any ramen left. I was so disappointed because I was craving ramen and didn't get to satiate that craving in the end.

Imagined and created by Frank Lloyd Wright, the Monona Terrace Community Center is said to have been Wright's \"dream civic center\".  The irony of this was, although Wright dreamed it in 1938- the center did not become a reality until 1992.\n\nThe building is beautiful- a semi circle of white nestled on the edge of Lake Monona.  The interesting thing about the design is that since it is only 2 blocks from the Capital building- it links the Capital and the lake it sits on making them almost one unit.  In true Wright style- a portion of the building extends about 90 feet over the water and has a curved wall of windows that allows visitors to see the lake in its entirety.\n\nThe meeting rooms can accommodate groups of all sizes and the food service within the Center is good. \n\nThere is also a rooftop garden that is ideal for parties.  We had cocktails out there along with a jazz band one evening and it was absolutely an incredible experience as you could not only see the lake, but by turning around- you could view the Capital and downtown Madison.\n\nThe walls of the center are lined with pictures of Frank Lloyd Wright and many of his projects across the country.  Guided tours are given daily at 1:00 and cost $3.  There is also a small gift shop carrying Frank Lloyd Wright and Madison souvenirs.\n\nThis center is joined to the Hilton Hotel by a walkway which allows guests of the hotel attending conventions in the center to move freely between the two structures.\n\nWhat was a dream in 1938, is today, a stunning tribute to the man who had the vision to dream.", "business_id": "QqHl5Z0p8eAWxWxcTtaWkw", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-06-07", "type": "review"}

Small in size and curt in customer service it was with admitted indecision that our group approached the Cugino's counter and ordering on-the-fly a six-part meal emerged, the $66 meal presented in four courses with plenty of leftovers and mostly impressive results.  Undoubtedly a red sauce joint despite a multitude of housemade salads and sandwiches it was with fried pillows of ricotta gnocchi that the meal began and with each creamy morsel crispy on the exterior but virtually oilless I was immediately impressed - a trend continued in the tender rice ball buried in house-pulled mozzarella and tangy marinara.  Obviously prone to over-ordering, particularly in small groups, our trio next doubled down on a pair of pies and while the thin white pie proved somewhat bland to my tastes with a mundane crust tinged with semolina the Sicilian dazzled as fresh mozzarella formed soft puddles amidst aromatic tomato sauce bright with acid and appropriately devoid of sugar.

Located in a typical strip mall on West Flamingo and featuring a concept self described as 'Japanese tapas' the evening began with the simple decision of bar versus table and opting for the later amidst a warm yet stark interior it was to the tune of a shared $95 omakase plus several supplements that the meal unfolded - an invigorating paco-jet concentrated cucumber amuse setting the stage for what would follow.  Beginning first with a trio of fried happy hour bar-snacks from which the 'best' would be impossible to select and then transitioning into several amply portioned plates both cold and hot it was early on that a consistent pattern of superlative proteins over bright citrus and subtle aromatics emerged, the Suika Saka and Sakana Yaki particularly enthralling while the slightly overcooked Niku Berry's beef proved that a m\u00e9lange of mushrooms can truly save a plate, particularly served point/counterpoint with tart early-season strawberries.

I tend to like their commercials, and they have some decent discounts/specials: like right now it's summer shake season, with half off shakes after 8PM.\n\nWent in today and got a peanut butter chocolate flavor for myself, with a chocolate java chiller for my guy. He also took the liberty of adding on a garlic parm hotdog on their new cheese bread dogs, and an order of their little-known \"extreme tots\"- chili cheese tots with ranch and jalapenos.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of the food with this chain and this location didn't stand out from others. Tots are typically too salty for me, ordering them this way lessened the salt flavor. Hotdog, despite the special bun, did not have much flavor either, but the parm sauce on it was pretty interesting.\nShakes were thick and large- prices here seem higher than I'm used to though. PBC shake was better than the java chiller, but I'd like to see a coffee flavor on their shake menu in the future.\n\nI like how the drive-up stands have credit card slots to pay after you order. Wish they could add on a feature to tip this way. I'm always baffled about how much/whether to tip someone to bring me my order, but here the drive-thru section gives you the option to go their instead of to a stand if you know you don't want to tip or don't have cash in addition to your card.", "business_id": "S4nbHSW29N0rcXkIlA-wbQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-06-23", "type": "review"}

Discussing amongst ourselves while scouring other tables for evidence of portion size we eventually settled on one appetizer, two pastas, and a pizza...we then began the agonizing process of deciding which option sounded best.  \n\nBaked in house the first basket was had only three options while the second arrived with a fourth.  With each bread a great example of its particular type the baskets featured a smoky Rustic Italian, buttery Semolina Vienna, amply sour sesame seed crusted Sourdough, and a buttery moist Foccacia.  While I rather wish the pairing would have been a nice olive oil as opposed to butter neither were really necessary with all the sauce that required mopping up.\n\nBeginning the meal as the sounds of eager diners bounced around the wonderfully decorated brick and tile interior was a delightful Arancini with creamy arborio rice providing a slightly toothsome contrast to velvety fried Mozzarella.   An ample portion for a mere $6 the dish was only enhanced by resting the crispy balls of cheese in a pool of house-made marinara.  Remember the comment about the bread - a whole basket was used to dredge the plate clean of the aromatic and slightly acidic sauce.\n\nSelecting two of the eighteen pastas the pair was delivered simultaneously and looking back I still cannot decide which was better.  Beginning first with the Paglia E Fieno, a spinach and egg tagliatelle with peas, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano-reggiano, and cream I was stunned by the bouncy texture of the pasta to tooth yet its undeniable melt-in-the-mouth texture upon mastication...al dente done just right.  Complimenting the pasta were sweet and snappy peas, a smooth and salty prosciutto, and a pungent parmigiano-reggiano that added texture and pungency.  All balanced by a somewhat sweet cream sauce the entire dish was well thought out, well balanced, and divine.\n\nNot to be outdone, Gnocchi Di Ricotta featuring Ricotta Gnocchi, Butter, Sage, and Parmigiana-Reggiano was a dish that would have the three of us fighting for the last dumpling.  Simply prepared, as one expects from a rustic dish like gnocchi, the dumplings were undoubtedly the star of the dish-literally melting puddles of potato and ricotta cheese that provided little resistance to tooth, yet enough body to support and absorb the subtly sweet and aromatic sauce.  Topped with a quick grating of cheese and cracked black pepper the gnocchi was one of the best I've ever tasted-a skilled hand, perfect cooking conditions, and largely un-fussed-with.\n\nEnjoying all the previous efforts so much the \"star\" of the afternoon was nearly an afterthought-and one heck of an afterthought given that it is where the restaurant made its name.  Opting for the Provola with Smoked Mozzarella di bufala, Cherry Tomatoes, Fresh Basil, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Baby Arugula, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil we watched as the dough emerged from the temperature controlled room, was rolled by hand, topped and was placed inside the stone oven for a mere 90 seconds.  Emerging bubbly and charred the pizza was topped with a heap of fresh arugala, drizzled with olive oil and a quick shredding of Parmigiano-Reggiano before being plated and brought to the table.  Squeaky and smoky the cheese was a perfect foil for the cornmeal accented and yeasty dough.  Crisp and toasted around the circumference of the 13 inche pie and sopping wet at the center each ingredient was pronounced in flavor with the super sweet tomatoes and basil forming the foundation and the bite of the parmigiano and bitterness of the Arugula providing a nice compliment of flavor.\n\nArriving quickly and in ample portion the house made desserts were both presented simply and unadorned.  Beginning first with the Tiramisu-a rather standard example with buttery lady fingers, smooth mascarpone, high quality cocoa, ribbons of chocolate, and a hefty shot of rum-it was good, but like many pre-prepared versions it was largely unbalanced with the rum soaking the bottom layer and cream dominating the top.  Significantly more impressive was the Cannoli, a crisp and slightly cinnamon accented shell housing a lightly lemon tinged ricotta cream.  One end dipped in crushed pistachio, the other in chocolate chips, and sitting atop a bed of hand whipped cream-light, refreshing, and authentic.\n\nGreat service, everything expertly prepared, and prices that fit the quality of the ingredients I was very happy with every aspect of our meal.

The two brothers performing feats of strength and balance are awe inspiring. All of the performers are amazing, the stage sets are like a psychedelic forest, and the costumes are super colorful.

It didn't take too long before I was called.\n\nOnce I brought the Pizza back to my table, I quickly realized that I ordered too much Pizza.  I could easily eat all 3 Slices, but then I'd feel too full.  The Slices are pretty big, so consider yourself warned!\n\nThe first Slice I went for was the Meat Pie.  The Crust is much thicker than the other Slices of Pizza and the Meats are buried within a ton of Cheese.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=q1Ts-19RUkbAy2GEi11Ciw\nI liked the flavor of it although I couldn't taste the Meatballs.  The Bacon, Ham, Pepperoni, and Sausage flavors were easily identifiable and delicious.  The Double Crust was more on the edge of the Slice than throughout the Pie.  Despite wanting to eat this with my hands, I had to commit the Mortal Sin of eating Pizza and ate it with a fork because the weight of the Slice was too much for the thin Crust to bear.  Next time I'll probably just go with the Super Meaty, which is the same ingredients on their normal Thin Crust.\n\nNext up I went for the Jalapeno & Pepperoni Slice.  Since it's NY Style Thin Crust, you have to fold this bad boy.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=ZiF9E3htkJ-ux6JLyyZtkg\nThe Pepperoni was full of flavor and the Jalapenos packed a nice kick.  The Crust was nice and crispy since I asked for it to be \"well done\".\n\nLast but not least was the Super Meaty.  I wasn't sure if the crust would hold up with all of that Meat on it, but it did.  The Slice was full of flavor and as I mentioned above, like the Meat Pie, I could identify every Meat on the Slice except the Meatball.  This Slice is the Thin Crust version of the Meat Pie.....very delicious.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=Gx_4cQ3K4pBUBY6L9974aQ\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the Pizza here at Joe's.  However, I thought the prices were a bit high compared to other Pizza joints in Vegas.  I guess being so close to the Strip is a big factor.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%", "business_id": "0x4NXJFSQRRUNONxINTjWQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-19", "type": "review"}

First fell in love with the store in California, then the company was bought out and closed several locations, and I was happy to find this one within a few blocks of my work today.\n\nWhat stands out about this location is the friendly staff- for a place that has barely any employees and all self-checkout, I often come to expect no interaction with store staff. But here? I was greeted upon entry, checked on once during my visit as I looked for an item, and was thanked as I left.\n\nStore layout is the same as other F&E's, making it easy to find the clearance rack and the essential items you came in for- though the majority of my time is always spent scouring the refrigerated cases for discount stickers. Love how all locations start marking premade items, produce, and meats the day before or day of their sale expiration- just wish I knew when they put the stickers out!\n\nSide note about this location in particular: they actually have an in-store bakery, which I have yet to see in other locations. Bread/bakery section is larger here because of this, which is nice, though I don't buy those items.\n\nAlso of note: the parking closest to the store entrance is divided between Hybrid car-specific spaces and families with children spaces, as indicated by signage. Found this odd and a slight bit infuriating (well, the hybrid cars thing- I can support safer parking for kiddos), given the astronomical heat we get in this city. But whatever.\n\nGreat markdowns, in-store juices, presence and friendliness of staff? All good!\nJoin their friends program with email coupons- hate having to print them (so old school!) but they're good value, up to $3 off (obviously not applicable to mark-down prices). \nOne of my favorite items here is the sweet onion cashews, definitely pick up a bag to try!", "business_id": "6-un66T64yBWFClv5l4pGQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-06-03", "type": "review"}

The Bread is decent and the Whole sized portion is enough for 2 people.\n\nUncle Sam's Special Pizza (18\" Large, $23.95) - It has virtually every topping on it.  Because it's crammed with toppings, it tends to get a little soggy even if it's ordered well done, which is how I order it.  Flavor is pretty good.  We always take a few slices home and it heats up well for leftovers.\n\nWings (Baker's Dozen, $7.95) - Our friends don't like the really spicy stuff, so we always order the Medium spice level and the Spicy on the side.  The Wings are really good.  Always served hot and they break away from the bone well.  The Spicy sauce isn't too Spicy....I like spicy food, so it's about average for me.\n\nLarge basket of Fries $3.23 - Decent sized basket.  Can serve 2-3 people.  Average flavor, reminds me of Wendy's Fries in terms of size and style.\n\nLarge basket of Fried Zucchini $4.95 - Can serve 2-3 people.  The flavor is average.  Always served hot and crispy.  I've never had soggy Zucchini here, which is a pet peeve.\n\nThe restaurant has plenty of seating and can easily accommodate a large group.

Still, after dropping in here the other day for a quick dinner it is definitely worth a second look.\n\nYeah, it has all the standard retro pictures, movie/sports posters, and goofy memorabilia hanging on the walls that is the basis of their cheeseball decor.

Two boneless chicken breasts rubbed with a chili seasoning and served with a side of salsa and two dipping sauces -  salsa & creamy lime sauce. Also comes with a salad with tortilla strips in it.

I guess Todd himself dined here and had an experience similar to mine, and didn't want his name associated with the place.\n\nThe food ranged from tasty cheese on the charcuterie board and surprisingly good espresso martinis, to average/mediocre everything else- and we ordered a lot. Tables are initially served a breadbasket with three mismatched breads, and a tray of olives and two tapenades- the green is best.\n\nCHARCUTERIE BOARD: two types of tasty cheeses (one was a blue), two types of meat (salami and prosciutto?), dates, candied walnuts, and crisps. Wish I could tell you what type of cheese it was, but all dishes were presented without any sort of explanation or comment.\nFOIE GRAS: served with fresh fig (singular), port reduction (gross), and truffle crema (tastless, certainly no truffle here). Served without any sort of crackers or bread, and our breadbasket was empty and no one ever refilled it.  Did not care for the texture, flavors seemed off. Would have shared this with my server, but we never saw him.\n\nBRICK OVEN ROASTED FREE RANGE CHICKEN: served with a potato cake and green means, all amid a sea of tasty jus, but the chicken itself was bland. Recurring issue with dishes here. Again, even just salt would have helped this dish.\nBONE-IN NY STRIP SPECIAL: served with green beans and fingerling potatoes, steak was plated with a giant puddle of some sort of cabernet sauce? Guess it was meant to hide the fact that the meat was flavorless aside from gobs of fat in every bite, and unseasoned to the point that it desperately needed salt. No char or sear at all. \n\nMUSHROOM RISOTTO: decent-ish side, mediocre version of a favorite dish. The table ate the entire portion though.\nCRISPY ZUCCHINI: no menu description, expected a roasted version but received a plate of tempura zuke covered with cheese. Hard not to like that but odd considering the rest of the menu. \n\nAs you can see, we had issues with the service. The restaurant wasn't that busy, yet we rarely saw our server. Literally went 20 minutes wanting a martini that I couldn't order because he never came by. When he did, he didn't seem to care at all. We were asked what we wanted to drink, what we wanted to order, and if we had any questions- no intro, no script, no explanation of specials, devoid of personality.

Skipping over seemingly out-of-place pizzas and pastas, though we were assured that these too are common to the cuisine, and focusing instead on the items favored by Luby as well as personal tastes it was with dense, warm milk bread that we began and with plates coursed out one-by-one appetizers commenced with lightly spiced Portuguese chorizo, ablaze on presentation and smoky with a snappy kielbasa-esque flavor, followed by squeaky griddled Halloumi with house-made sweet and sour serving to balance the brine.  Moving next to tender snails in thick garlic cream it was fourth that the primary reason for my visit arrived and living up to high hopes the milk-soaked and shredded preserved cod was perfect as two large cylinders arrived featuring ample salinity balanced by smashed potatoes, eggs, and subdued aromatics to form something rich, rustic, and satisfying...something I routinely seek out elsewhere now done well in my own back yard.  Rounding out the savories with two more richly sauced proteins including snappy squid in bright curry and tender chicken with notes of cumin, paprika, and something citrus perfuming the palate it was with full stomachs that Luby compelled us to order dessert, the tiramisu made by herself that morning, and whether 'traditional' or not I'm uncertain but either way the scoop of light mascarpone and bold coffee was much like the rest of the afternoon - delicious, comfortable, and served with gracious smiles and requests to come back soon, something I've no doubt the bacalao will compel.", "business_id": "LGOlwgFhNgVGfUEGIpY-jQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-02-23", "type": "review"}

Their HH pricing allows you to get a good sample of the menu's food and drinks for a discounted price, available 4-7PM daily including holidays!\nAlso, you're able to order from the HH menu TO-GO, which is unheard of elsewhere- and appreciated. \n\nLOBSTER GRILLED CHEESE $9; smallish sandwich served with a veritable mountain of seasoned fries. Combining cheese and seafood is always a little dicey in my book but this dish does it well. Sadly, the fries, though plentiful and visibly seasoned, lacked flavor and crisp. They also do not reheat well, consider yourself warned.\n\nKOREAN PORK RIBS: $11, four ribs with gochujang glaze served with peanuts and mint. Or they're supposed to. Mine came sad and lonely on a plate with zero presentation. Admittedly I ordered them right before HH ended but presentation should still be consistent and the additional components likely would have made the dish much better. As it was, I wouldn't rush to order them again but did find them to be a bit meatier than expected. Flavor was one-note, sauce seemed to be sriracha-based, wouldn't order again.\n\nCINNAMON HARLOT: $7 George Dickel rye whiskey simple syrup, cinnamon. A simple sipping drink, very strong, ordered on the rocks and got a cool boulder of ice in my glass. Not wanting to be plastered after one drink, I asked for it to be diluted with Sprite, which is apparently fairly common. Decent flavor but not something I'd get again.\n\nSANGRIA: $8 red red wine, velvet falernum spiced rum, blackberry liqueur, lemon. It's rare for me to find a sangria I don't like, so I really enjoyed this drink much more than the Harlot. Fruity and strong with bold flavors, decent drink size too.\n\nService bumped up the score higher than the product alone- bartender was attentive and friendly, accommodated my HH order for takeout and fixed my drink to my liking.

That being said, considering how large it was I did find it odd that the only aquarium I heard of in the city was inside of a casino, but I suppose that's the Vegas way. I'll save my commentary on the decline of independently funded state and educational programs for another day.\n\nFirst off, a delightful family ahead of me in line gave me a free ticket after accidentally ordering an extra. I don't know if a refund was not possible or if they were just super laid back, but it was very much appreciated. A lot of the reviews I'd read before coming stated how the price did not reflect the experience- at $18/adult, i'm not sure I disagree.\n\nThis aquarium reminded me of the Dallas state aquarium, in that it had a creative use of space that involved more of an outdoor feel with an Amazon-warrior theme for their open area, and that they were able to incorporate animals aside from fish. The first thing you see when you go in is a crocodile, then a komodo dragon and a tank of cichiids, before getting to some amazon fish and some lizards. Information on conservation is scattered throughout. Several large tanks are toward the end of your tour, and there are several informational plaques and computer displays set up for perusal. \n\nMy favorite part was by far the tunnel, and I probably spent a good 15 minutes in there. Many families and other visitors passed me by quite frequently, which may be why the price is seen as \"too high\"- they rush through and it's over and done with pretty fast. I will admit that it is small though- despite my lingering and genuine fascination with the exhibits, I was in and out in under an hour, probably closer to 45 minutes. \n\nThe room after the tunnel has a touch tank of rays, which is always fun. As an educator, I like when museums and aquariums incorporate hands-on aspects for kids and adults rather than just things to see or read and a strict directive to keep hands off. The experience could be improved with more video rather than plaques, and perhaps more marketing geared toward adults rather than children, as they didn't seem to be engaged in much aside from the tanks at their level. \n\nThe giant shark tank at the end of the tour, with the shipwreck decor, was a little overdone. It was cool to see the sharks and all, but with the name \"SHARK reef aquarium\" it was a little underwhelming. I had expected to see more sharks in the smaller tanks rather than just one or two culminating in the large room of sharks. Also, the tank itself was virtually empty of any decor- whether this is an oversight (it seemed boring to me) or simply best for visibility or the sharks' preference, I couldn't say. \n\nI'm not usually a gift shop person, but given that my admission was covered by that polite family, I stopped in. Sadly there wasn't too much selection in the way of adult shirts- one or two with gaudy lettering/stupid phrases, but mostly cheesy water-print tees featuring a shark mouth on the front circa 1990. Saw a lot of cuter kids tees but nothing in a size that would have worked for me. Other than shirt selection, there was a lot of kid-friendly type stuff, which again contrasted with the lack of kid-centric display materials in the exhibit itself. \n\nPretty decent aquarium considering it's in a casino. Worth a visit if you aren't annoyed by the price, but definitely plan to linger. Watching the jellies, fish tunnel, and octopus are good places for this.", "business_id": "NBFu9Ia-KzpsByWtoB6JhA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-20", "type": "review"}

A bustling restaurant, but not a particularly \"loud\" one despite filling to capacity before we made our exit service was every bit as professional as expected and with drinks readily refilled the kitchen moved efficiently sending out our selections in three courses with excellent timing as the meal kicked off with a bread basket not quite as lovely as the salumi bread at Scarpetta, but warm with a truly impressive Focaccia which I had to mindful to resist after the first slice.\n\nMoving on to the proper plates, the first course arrived as a half order of thick, toothsome pici topped with a truffle-laden sauce of tomato and duck confit that was expectedly rustic and rich while its counterpart, the oft raved Filone with a poached duck egg sitting atop cheese fondue was equally rich but ever more refined, the silky mix of egg and cheese atop hot bread without a doubt the best dish of a meal full of good choices.  Following the appetizers, a main course of steak with a side of fries was pronounced by my friend to be good, but not $62 good while the $22 Margherita featured top quality ingredients and great char, but failed to reach the highs of the pie at Due Forni which cost substantially less.\n\nUnwilling/Unable to pass on dessert despite another full meal in just a couple of hours the early evening at D.O.C.G. ended with the house specialty Salted Caramel Budino and yes, without a doubt, this is a signature dessert worth the rave reviews as the dense pudding walks a fine line between too sweet and too salty with bits of toffee acting as a textural contrast; it would have been great with coffee and along with the filone is reason enough to pay D.O.C.G. a visit (even with the exorbitant on-strip markup)", "business_id": "wZxrcIHmkhT4OHvIxPwd_A", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-05-22", "type": "review"}

Small in size but diverse in selections with steamer tables, chilled sections, prep-to-order, and a whole room of desserts it was with Asian options that I began and with sliced to order Peking Duck on warm bao the star of the show both dim sum and crab soup would show equally well while congee proved mealy and flavorless leading me to overlook the noodle station in favor of things more unique.  Focused next on cold tables it was in exotic ingredients and iced shellfish that Jasmine hoped to justify its pricetag and although the King Crab was fine while foie gras pastry proved addicting the sushi, cheeses, charcuterie, and salads were rather pedestrian - a toothsome muesli better fitting as dessert a rare exception to the rule.  Moving through more \"American\" selections including a decadent pot pie, two delicious benedicts, and casserole-style French Toast imbued with banana and Nutella while quickly discarding flaccid waffles and dried out breakfast breads it was finally in sweets that nearly everything excelled - a well culled selection from which I nearly sampled the gamut - a Jean Phillipe's gelato station, perfect puffs of choux, and DIY fondue all receiving repeat visits with Asian pastries decidedly conspicuous in their absence.  Undoubtedly a special space but maligned by service faux-pas necessitating requests for refills plus clean utensils suffice it to say that although 'luxe' in many ways a brunch at Jasmine does not come cheap and while some items shined none but the duck was on par with Wing-Lei's Chinese New Year while neither service nor selection were equal to Wicked Spoon which rings in at nearly half the price after tax, tip, and drinks.", "business_id": "uCZe5GLqTeadjTLlvWNF4w", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-05-28", "type": "review"}

Moving next to a duo of classics, suffice it to say that whatever led to the morning delay and rushed prep-work yielded far too oily an old fashioned along with a flaccid yeast-raised ring but moving on to the filled options the chef's skills shined as house-made creams, compotes, purees, and curds all impressed inside yeasty pockets with an array of delicate glazes.

Beginning first with a pliable soft corn tortilla and then stacking on layer after layer of aromatic mushrooms plus a mixture of cheeses both mild and slightly briny this was a dish that greeted the palate well before the tongue and while the top notes of truffle were certainly notable, it was the intensity of the corn smut sauce that really put the it over the top.\n\nQueso Fundido - Duck Barbacoa, Poblano Chile Rajas, Queso Mixto:  Transitioning from the salads and small plates portion of the menu to the tacos, the first to arrive was a DIY affair with rich and unctuous pulled duck meat buried beneath a layer of still bubbling cheese.  Slow cooked and tender with spices including (but certainly not limited to) cumin, oregano, cloves, garlic at the forefront plus plenty of heat from the mixed pepper this was an ample serving to say the least but arriving with plenty of fresh tortillas it didn't even last long enough to cool off completely.\n\nMahi-Mahi - Chipotle Remoulade, Avocado, Red Cabbage, Lime:  Having heard that this was 'the best dish on the menu' by the valet as I parked the car I have to admit I'd probably not have ordered this dish a la carte simply because I've never once had Dolphinfish that wowed me...and that would have been a mistake.  Featuring the mildly flavored fish lightly fried inside a delicate plantain batter the key to this dish was actually the juxtaposition of its accoutrements - the lightly pickled cabbage foiled by the creamy avocado while a light touch of lime brought all the flavors to a point.\n\nCochinita Pibil - Berkshire Pork Shoulder, Achiote, Pineapple BBQ:  For our 'main course' of the evening a large bowl of smoky pork would arrive with an ample description from Michael and with aromatics abound I only wished I had saved more room.  Reportedly roasted for nearly eight hours wrapped in banana leaves and subsequently braised with achiote seeds, oregano, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, sour orange, and more this was the sort of Mexican cuisine we simply don't have back in the Midwest - incredibly complex, nicely nuanced, and literally melt-in-the-mouth tender...the sort of dish that makes me want to explore the region's cuisine more and more.\n\nArroz Con Crema - Creamy Poblano Corn Rice:  Think rice pudding but make it intensely savory with plenty of spice - now make it so rich and texturally refined that all but the best risottos would pale in comparison.  At $5 this is the steal of the menu and I'm disappointed even now that I couldn't eat every bite of the cast iron pot. \n\nEl Fuerte - Flourless Chocolate Cake, Spicy Peanuts, Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse, Vanilla Bean Flan, XO Caramel, Espresso Ice Cream:  Reportedly a dish for two and although I'd have questioned this statement under normal circumstances it was not only enough for two at the end of such a long meal, but after taking my first bite definitely more than one person should rationally eat.  Essentially three squares loosely stacked and topped with GTC Espresso Ice Cream and candied peanuts dusted with chili before a tableside pour of caramel spiked (liberally) with what I believe was Patron XO Caf\u00e9 this was one rich dessert.  Dense on the bottom and light on the top with subtle differences in each bite depending on the various components sampled both Aileen and I worked on this dish slowly and bite after bite it seemed neither of us could stop until I finally threw in the napkin...at least until Aileen left a single bite on the plate and I took the bait, recollected my spoon, and finished it off.\n\nThe Verdict:  While some may piss n' moan that \"Mexican Street Food\" should be served on the streets of Mexico using less esoteric ingredients than Berkshire Pigs, Hudson Valley Ducks, and Black Truffles I'll simply beg to differ and continue my belief that any cuisine can benefit from top quality ingredients in the hands of a skilled and passionate kitchen.  Sure some may question the authenticity of Garces' restaurants or the choice location in a fancy hotel but to those of us who value things like impeccable service, comfortable environs, and the 'experience' of fine dining at a veritable bargain basement price I whole heartedly recommend giving Distrito a look - along with Bayless' Michelin starred Topolobampo it is the best Mexican food I've had to date.", "business_id": "lKQ5hnkSQ-XP80jNCH46nQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-26", "type": "review"}

Generally underwhelmed by custards as compared to artisan ice creams or gelatos in the past I'd hardly realized that the small window had such an extensive menu of flavors until I approached, but with standards of chocolate and vanilla plus seasonal cheesecake, cherry pie, blue moon, and countless toppings, sauces, and mix-ins I was glad to have some time to think - eventually settling on a $4.25 cash-only \"Butter Crunch\" over vanilla custard plus a large spooned sample of cherry pie.  Traditional in texture, full bodied with flavor, unmistakably custard given a light egginess to the vanilla, and with substantially more heft than the versions popularized at iconic Ted Drewes' or franchised Rita's it took a few rich spoonfuls to truly appreciate the velvety texture of the custard itself as I worked through toppings acting more as a distraction than a compliment but once down to creamy base it can only be said that this is indeed some excellent custard and for fans of the style it is a 'must visit,' though for my dining dollars the presence of Art of Flavors only a few blocks away will make a return unlikely anytime soon as even the \"best\" custard can't hold a candle to truly superlative gelato.", "business_id": "uYVdp5LfCbX8S8ytnhdk-g", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-02-11", "type": "review"}

Paris is not one of those properties that come to mind when people in Vegas think of nightlife but they sure have been trying for quite a while.\n\nThe ambiance is tired and the club itself is a little too dated to be more posh than it really is.  The bouncers and staff still try to pass off the place as it if it's Tao or Tryst, but even they know there is not much going on here other than the occasional eye candy that most clubs will have anyway.\n\nDrinks are over priced and weak.  The plastic cups are typically filled with lots of ice, enough to where the drink is barely more than a shot's worth of alcohol with something else (like gin & tonic or coke & bourbon).  It is more disappointing when the bartenders don't care about their drinks and complain about the drinks.\n\nIt's only saving grace is their DJ line up.  A lot of up-and-comers are busting out their scratches here and really making the dance floor what it is was intended to be.  My favorite night here so far is Latin night.  They pump out some cool Latin hits and mix it with a sick track to make it a hell of a rendition.  Plenty of cute girls and guys galore, and its hot in here especially during the summer.

I was pretty certain they'd be open, but just to make sure I called beforehand. I tried starting at 10am but no answer.... closer to 11am they answered and indeed were open -- at 11am!\n\nWe headed over there, got seated, looked at a menu and our server, a Shanghainese man, seemed quite pleased to speak my home dialect with me.\n\nThey don't have salty soy milk and if you want sweet soy milk, you can add the sugar yourself. What they bring to you is a bowl of plain soy milk -- which was fine by us because we added some vinegar and soy to it and it sufficed. Not the best, but it worked.\n\nThe XLB arrived right after the soymilk and immediately, I knew they wouldn't be very good. A few had pierced through so all the juicy liquid had oozed out. I picked up an XLB and put the thing in my mouth after dipping it into vinegar -- hmmmm --- the piece of meat was too dense -- definitely not good enough for me to come back just for these, but what followed turned out to be a really wonderful surprise.\n\nPotstickers arrived and after biting into one I was completely sold! These were some of the most perfect potstickers I've ever had -- crispy on the bottom and still succulent everywhere else. the wrapper wasn't too thick and the filling not too small -- it was pretty damn good!\n\nSheng jian bao (don't know what they are called in English) are these little buns which contain pork. I've not had anything this perfect in the US. The bottom was crispy and the top had the perfect pillowy softness of the bao. Most places I've had these at would steam the bun first and then fry the buns when you order. This is the wrong way to cook these. The name 'sheng jian bao' literally means pan frying the bun from its raw format. What they do is, they fry the raw bun in a pan, add liquid, close the lid to 'steam' the bun as it cooks the filling and the top part of the bun, remove lid and wait until the bottom is dry, remove and serve. \n\nAnd how do I know that these were done the correct way? Well, there is a certain crust that forms on the bottom and around the bun and these ones had it. The other sign is that the bun part is like a pillow when you bite into them, not hard and dense like those you might find at dim sum where they steam the buns and then pan fry them.\n\nDefinitely some of the best sheng jian baos ever!\n\nCong you bing -- was okay, wasn't the best I've ever had, a little too greasy, but they used enough scallions so it was a plus.\n\nI saw another table had the beef roll and couldn't resist but order some. This was another dish which is done to perfection here! They are generous with the five spiced beef filling and the condiments like cilantro is ample but not too much or too little.

It is near the corner of W McDowell and Dysart, in a Lowe's big box mall. \n\nIt is Korean owned, managed and the sushi chefs are all Korean, too.\nThey spent quite a bit on decor, and it reminds me a bit like a Scottsdale type establishment in decor, but considerably cheaper food than your RA's or Sapporo in upscale Snotsdale. \n\nIt is large, with a Z shaped sushi bar with a high counter. Jay is the main sushi chef, Jason the second, and although he is middle aged Korean, he learned the trade in Cambridge, MA from an older Japanese chef. He has also plied his trade in Irvine, La Canada and Santa Barbara, CA before coming out to Goodyear. This is the only Japanese restaurants in this neck of the valley. \n\nThe bar area has large red paper lanterns, and you can order sushi while guzzling your favorite adult beverage. In the dining area, the sushi bar is decorated with bamboo covered lanterns. The surfaces are of solid heavy materials. A copper 3/4 moon platter designates each sushi bar seat. \n\nAs is typical of a made-for-Americans-Korean-owned Japanese sushi bar, you order off the check list menu, which is handed to the chef. Jay served my nigiri selctions in rectangular platers of heavy ceramic. The dishware was modern and esthetically attractive. The sushi was OK for Goodyear, but certainly not to major coastal city standards. The prices were perhaps a tiny bit high, perhaps to pay for the decor.\n\nThe dining area has 3 plasma TVs: 2 showing sports, and the center one running a commercial for Tomo itself, with names and pictures of Chefs, and colorful pix of some of their signature appetizers (i.e. baked green mussels) and sushi rolls (the regulars plus others)\n\nIt is funny, even though I could pass for a Mexican Terrorist, they were initially suspicious of me, like I was scoping the place out to open a competitive restaurant in the area. Maybe because I only ordered nigiri. They relaxed after I kept reassuring them. \n\nYou are served miso shiro right away and a crispy salad after that, included. They charge for green tea, though, $1.95! But then, the couple to the left and right of me both drank large sodas with their sushi! Maybe with Safeway sushi, but dining out?

The banquet facilities are large and most open out on to the outdoors which make breaks nice.\n\nThe guest rooms are standard sized with all the amenities that you need including a layering of duvets (perfect cuz who needs a heavy duvet  when it's 120 degrees outside?) free in room coffee, and a bathroom with a stand alone shower which has excellent water pressure and a rain shower option.

Prior to seeing the O show, BF and I came here for dinner on a Friday night- not thrilled that they don't take reservations so the line wraps around the corner for a predictable 30 minute minimum wait. But the hostess was super sweet and the wait went fast.\n\nBEER BATTERED MAUI ONION RINGS: The cheddar-ranch dip made this dish for me, but wasn't enough to save the rings for my guy, who felt they were overly breaded and not crispy enough. Wouldn't get again but loved the sauce.\n\nHELL'S KITCHEN BURGER: asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno pepper, avocado, and oven roasted tomato. Looked a bit more delicious than it actually tasted, the jalapeno is a kick in the mouth that is quickly quelled by the cold, creamy avocado and roasted tomato. Wish it came with more than one roasted jalapeno, the first bite of combined flavors was best, the rest only had one or two of the featured ingredients and came off as bland.\n\nFARM BURGER: duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar, and a fried egg. The egg makes this, but everyone else seems to say the bacon makes it. I'm not a huge bacon fan but expected to be converted by this one. Not so much. Egg yolk plus medium-rare burger was delish, cheese flavor was lost and overpowered by the other ingredients.\n\nTRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES: After the 'rings ordeal, I didn't think we needed another side but BF insisted. The order is enormous and even with our large appetites we did not come close to finishing. The truffle parm and truffle salt don't hold a candle to the amazing truffle aioli. \n\nSHAKE #5: coffee shake, chocolate pudding, \"praline cookie\". Served in one giant glass with two wide boba-style straws, this was a tasty treat. Liked that it wasn't super sweet. Praline cookie is more of a wafer without much flavor.  \n\nOVERALL:  Food didn't quite live up to the hype: bummed there isn't a mushroom burger with cheese on the menu, but for the two burgers we did order, the cheese was understated with both. Would customize a burger on a future visit, subbing chantrelle mushrooms for the tomato on the Euro burger. Rounding up for quality, as the actual beef was by far the best burger I've had in a damn long time.\n\nShout out to the hostess, who was super sweet, brought out a menu to view while in line, was the first of two staff to recommend the HK burger we ended up getting.", "business_id": "aGbjLWzcrnEx2ZmMCFm3EA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-09-20", "type": "review"}

It won a James Beard award long before many of the Italian style pizzerias featuring high quality, fresh ingredients started popping up in major cities across the country.  This Pizzeria Bianco (there is another location in the Phoenix area) is in Downtown Phoenix and is located just a few blocks away from the city's major sports venues like Chase Field.\n\nPizzeria Bianco has a great exterior with its historical looking brick structure.  The inside dining room is fairly small, but it is vibrant and comfortable and showcases a wood burning oven behind the bar.\n\nIn addition to their signature pizzas, Pizzeria Bianco's menu features a small selection of starters and salads.  Pizzeria Bianco's antipasto plate offers a variety of wood roasted vegetables, sopressata and a hard Italian cheese.  I did not really care much for the vegetables.  I felt they were a tad soggy and the broccoli was oddly sweet.  Zucchini and peppers were some of the other vegetables on the plate.\n\nI really liked the sopressata though.  It was not just a standard salty cured meat.  It had a good salty note, but it also had a bit of spiciness.  The sopressata was also perfectly thin and moist; it combined with the dry cheese and their baguette to make for a great bite.  Prosciutto wrapped figs were also on the antipasto plate.\n\nI tried a variety of their pizzas.  My favorite would be their margherita.  All of the ingredients were good.  There was a good tomato sauce, nicely melted mozzarella (the right amount too) and fragrant basil.  I did feel those same ingredients shined more at Los Angeles Italian pizzerias like Pizzeria Mozza and Milo & Olive.  I also felt the crust at Pizzeria Bianco was a tad bland.  The crust at Pizzeria Bianco though was uniformly thin and crispy.\n\nI also had their margherita pizza and added prosciutto and arugula.  This was a good pizza though the prosciutto at Pizzera Mozza has a much more delicious flavor as well as a more satisfying thin and soft texture.  Their Wiseguy pizza with fennel sausage, roasted onion and smoked mozzarella was okay though I personally have never been a fan of pizzas without tomato sauce.\n\nService was quick and pleasant.\n\nPrices are okay.  Given that Pizzeria Bianco is a pizzeria, you are obviously going to be able to dine here at a much lower cost than other highly celebrated Phoenix restaurants, which tend to be more upscale and feature fine dining prices.  Pizzeria Bianco is priced similarly to most Los Angeles Italian pizzerias though it offers more reasonable prices than Pizzeria Mozza.\n\nPizzeria Bianco is a good option for Italian style pizza though I have enjoyed other places more for Italian style pizza like Los Angeles' Pizzeria Mozza and Milo & Olive and Minneapolis' Pizzeria Lola; while Pizzeria Lola does not have the great crust of Pizzeria Bianco, I felt the toppings, sauce and cheese at Pizzeria Lola were all more delicious.  I also thought my recent trip to Los Angeles' order-at-the-counter Pitfire put out a more satisfying pizza.\n\nStill, Pizzeria Bianco has a lot of history and it has inspired many pizzerias across the country including Pizzeria Mozza.  Given Pizzeria Bianco's similarities to many other Italian style pizzerias found in major metros like Los Angeles and San Francisco, it might not be the best choice if you are only in Phoenix for a night or two.  But if you can try some food that is more unique to Phoenix and still have a few lunch or dinner slots open, Pizzeria Bianco is worth a visit.\n\nI am not sure what the parking situation is in Downtown Phoenix, but it looks like parking would be easier to find here than downtown areas in other bigger cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco.  Pizzeria Bianco also offers valet parking.", "business_id": "VVeogjZya58oiTxK7qUjAQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-06-25", "type": "review"}

Beginning first with three Buldogi classics, two all-beef hotdogs and one order of fries, it should go without saying that both the franks and the house-made toppings were excellent and although fries proved a bit limp the combination of garlic and pork proved surprisingly light, the later gracing the briny Gang-nam for a smoky sapor that I only wish would have been present in the watery ham atop the underwhelming, bready, and overcooked Monte Cristo that arrived alongside an equally doughy waffle thankfully rescued by reference standard Korean Fried Chicken, crispy and lacquered with briny soy-caramel - by far the best bite of the afternoon and the best Korean Fried Chicken I've found in town.  Obviously a work in progress and still looking to find its footing amongst the staunch competition of Spring Mountain suffice it to say that sticking to the classics is a safe bet at Buldogi caf\u00e9 while wandering to more Americanized novelties is a risk; one Milner and team might better approach by being as creative as they are with the dogs - the pork belly and a quick trip to the deep fryer could do wonders for that sandwich.", "business_id": "aplrc7fN1tCcBUo8Vt_1zQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-04-30", "type": "review"}

It is a relaxing place for a killer drink and is ironically one of the least pretentious venues in the entire property.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Parasol Up and Parasol Down are almost two different venues. P-Up is the upstairs portion of the lounge, with comfy couches, dimmed lighting and a view of the lake from above. Downstairs is P-Down, where there is less seating near the bar but a more intimate feel all while taking in a view of the lake shows and seeing folks whisk on by.

There is some magic in the Pear-a-sol and the Venetian Spritz is a nice one to start with. Classic drinks like an Old Fashioned or a Cosmo are very tasty and strong enough to where a couple should be sufficient to get the night rolling.\n\nIf you're not sure what to get, be sure to score some recs from the bartender / cocktail waitress.

At only $7 for 24 hour on and off access it's a nifty little deal.\n\nJust like in NYC you get all kinds of characters on these buses - many tourists, some locals, a few homeless, and of course the crazy peeps that make you shake your head. They are double-decker buses and have lots of seating when not too crowded. Sure, it is a cheap deal but does make a lot of stops and the ride can get tedious. It makes you consider taking cabs instead, but you will pay more that way. The Deuce is a cost conscious way to explore the strip if watching your wallet. \n\nHey, why bother to walk in blazing heat to that next casino that you think is only a short distance away.

I repeated some favorites from my first visit - the spicy bloody mary, the fried pickles, The Rising Sun, and the Frozen Grasshopper - and all were as remembered.  In fact I'm mostly updating this just to document my bachelorette party in full, so if you want to see a full useful review, please see the original and ignore this post, which is basically for my diary use only.\n\nWe came at around seven o'clock and were told they were so backed up they were turning people away.  We put our name and number down anyway, expecting to wait at least an hour and a half.  I guess a lot of people were discouraged enough to bail, because we were seated after something like forty minutes.\n\nService was good, polite and moderately quick.  A few of my friends and I use FourSquare (sorry, Yelp), and we each got a complimentary Holstein's Spacial (not a typo on my end) Lager.  It was tasty, refreshing, and free, and I'm sorry to admit that we were too full to finish them and felt pretty bratty.  We did leave a nice tip.\n\nI did try a couple new things this time around, and I'll just note those here.  The Fun-Ghi (hey, you know that joke, don't you?) was a great burger with a beef patty, roasted portobello, caramelized onion, truffle oil, gruyere, frisee, and aioli.  The mushroom was great, and went really well with the beef.  All the other accompaniments took a back seat, letting the two top players have their day.  For dessert, we supplemented our Frozen Grasshopper with a Campfire Smores shake - Smirnoff marshmallow vodka, chocolate, marshmallow, and a graham cracker crumble.  I mean please I will never stock Smirnoff marshmallow vodka in my home bar, but it worked here.  The shake tasted like s'mores, and it was delicious.\n\nMy girls got my dinner, for which I am very grateful.  Holstein's was fun and full of tasty things, a great start to an epic bachelorette weekend.", "business_id": "BqrTtox0JbG-P_DKBB5bBw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-07-31", "type": "review"}

I called the night or two before and they said it would not be a problem as they'd have rooms ready. Super friendly reception staff that helped with anything needed (taxis, directions, check-in and check-out very easy). This got us all started on the right foot and was extremely appreciated by me as I could pop to my room upon my very early arrival (hello 4am wakeup call that morning!) \n\n*FREE breakfast with most room packages/platinum membership. Coffee as well from the Costa outpost near the bar. A nice perk! \n\n*The rooms are AOK. Very clean, but aging a bit. To be expected. It's an old building. \n\n*Aircon in the lobby, but not the rest of the rooms! It was stifling in my room but very cool in the late evening. Took many hours to cool down, but this is rare issue I'd think. There was a fan supplied in the room. \n\n*Rate, peak July season: \u00a3176/night. Not cheap, not overly expensive. \n\n*Very close proximity to Haymarket train station, Marks & Spencer, Boots, Starbucks, St. Mary's Cathedral. Easy access to all the city sites in a short 15-20 minute walk to the city center.\n\n*Taxis can be ordered via reception. \n\n*Lobby is a business traveler's dream! Tons of tables, comfortable chairs, outlets, and corners to tuck into to get some work done. Overall pretty quiet as well due to the layout. \n\n*Wifi is OK. Not amazing. Not the worst. You won't be using Skype effectively or streaming video but does the trick for email and basic functions. It's also FREE. \n\nSo overall I stayed here because I had some Hilton points to burn, but it was a very pleasant experience. It's a nice, quiet hotel with adequate rooms, friendly staff and is well situated to explore Edinburgh.\n\n\nPssst - sign up for Hilton Honors of course!", "business_id": "e8wCD4XNCcxSeTSrAU6xLA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-07-13", "type": "review"}

Clearly a spot where the impressive beer list supersedes the quality of the food our meal started off on the wrong foot when we were denied seating in the main dining room and placed in a smaller back bar area and although the bartender was pleasant enough while a great soundtrack played overhead it became quite obvious early on that our lack of enthusiasm for suds was unappreciated with food arriving slowly, often far from hot while water refills required direct inquiry.\n\nFocusing on the food, a first round of appetizers proved to be fine, if not wowing - the pretzel nothing to write home about and the \"do you want cheese with that\" commanding an unannounced $3 up charge while the dates and pecorino were a nice sweet and savory pairing with quality ingredients well prepared.  Last and perhaps least, a basket of fries was ordered by my aunt and although I'm far from an expert I found them to be a bit undercooked; more starchy and less fluffy than I'd prefer.  \n\n Moving on to the meat of the menu (pun intended) aside from being luke warm and served on a decent roll I do not understand the reviews for the brats at Brat Haus and, as a matter of fact, with all the ridiculously hefty spices I'd defy anyone to differentiate on blind tasting the difference between pig, duck, or turkey on any of our selections - a lack of subtlety that led to my mother giving up after a few bites and even challenged myself on the duck brat as I felt like I was eating the smell of Penzey's Spices more than anything protein.  Faring better - as a matter of fact quite a bit better - my aunt's burger with a supple and smoky patty, fried egg, and sharp Swiss was the highlight of the savories; a case of \"Keep it Simple, Stupid\" if there ever was one.\n\nFor desserts - generally not a beer fan I actually liked what the rich chocolate stout did to temper the sweetness of the dates and the waffle that so many have raved was indeed a light at the end of the tunnel; a light, airy, and golden crisp disc with a bit of spice balanced by the sweet honey showing that the kitchen can indeed achieve balanced boldness when they try - or perhaps when they DON'T try and end up overthinking and overshooting their mark as they did with the sausages.", "business_id": "PWG28q4JFOc8FiRBjnfCkA", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-06-01", "type": "review"}

A surprisingly large space, literally big enough to park a truck, it was an early arrival that assured us use of the large private dining room and with excellent service from both the general manager plus an enthusiastic young waiter it would not be long before our pizzas started to arrive and brought out in three separate courses it was with the signatures that we began, the \"limited\" Margherita proving cool to the touch and shockingly bland despite both excellent char and chew to the crust while the Cal-Italia proved far superior with a crunchy, toothsome crust more than able to stand up to a bevy  of toppings both sweet and savory, acidic and creamy.  Moving next to the interesting yet overly complicated and entirely too spicy Quail Egg selection it was at last the \"3-course\" Romana with its cracker crisp crust and well-paired toppings that wowed me most - the central third particularly well done with the rich meatballs nicely balanced by light cream and ample garlic, though the sweet selection was certainly not lacking in contrast or flavor either.  Moving last to a gifted half of the Farmer's Market Pizza, unfortunately overloaded with cinnamon just as the Quail Egg had been with spice, and finally to a trio of desserts where only the delicate pecan turnover would prove either inspired or memorable I think it is safe to say that the key to enjoying a meal at Pizza Rock is to simply embrace the concept and realize that \"everything to everyone\" and \"do one thing and do it well\" are very different mantras; the former definitely improved by a group of good people, excellent service, and (at least in this case) fond memories of 80's and 90's rock ballads.", "business_id": "MN0OLvP8i0SirMJ7AMuMzA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-12-02", "type": "review"}

Moving next to larger scale items, a duo of pho dishes would prove respectable if not particularly well presented; the supple oxtail imbuing long rice noodles with a meaty sapor while an enormous proximal femur laced its broth with fat to balance ample scallions, though heat remained mute even in the presence of sliced jalapenos.  Moving finally to the items that showed the kitchen's promise, suffice it to say that tender pork belly first braised then rendered soft in coconut milk proved by far the most complex option of the afternoon despite its unexpected sweetness and although a seemingly odd choice, the throwback 'get down n' dirty' shrimp finally delivered in the spice department, a pound of the snappy shell-ons again leaving my water-glass empty while wondering why we hadn't just gone to Crab Corner or Hot n' Juicy instead.", "business_id": "kJfT-kJUHQ-gxq0fhu4vdg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-04-13", "type": "review"}

Both were very annoying, and both fell during mealtime.  I went to Hissho to eat both times.\n\nThe first time, I was rushing to make my connecting flight and stopped off on Hissho to grab a roll.  There was a refrigerated section of to-go food, and the selection was pretty good - standard, sure, but a lot of options.  It took me a minute to pick an eel roll.  I ate it on the plane, and it was good.  It reminded me of the pre-packaged rolls I used to love at the cafeteria in college.  Nothing special, maybe, but satisfying.\n\nSo when I passed by Hissho in the same airport on a longer layover just a couple months later, I decided to sit down for some dinner.  I thought about getting another ready-to-go roll, but I made the mistake of opening the menu.  I had just heard Jonathan Gold review a Sinaloan sushi spot on the radio, and he said something like, \"It was good in the way chili fries are good,\" and for some reason that resulted in my ordering something called a Mango Trio.  It was an 8 piece roll with imitation crab, mango, cucumber, and mango-ginger cheese topped with salmon, tuna, and a mango habanero sauce.  I mean what the hell is mango-ginger cheese?  Anyway, the roll was edible but vaguely disgusting, with mediocre fish and an odd, goopy sauce.\n\nMy other big mistake was getting a drink.  I'm a sucker for a spicy bloody mary, and when I saw a chipotle bloody on the menu I decided to go for it.  It was the most disgusting bloody mary I've had in recent memory, very strong with a tinge of thin tomato and a bit of spice.  It had a double shot of vodka, so I guess it was at least functional.  When I got the check, though, I was shocked to see that it cost $14.  My shitty airport meal cost over $30.  Incidentally, service was also very slow.  Surprising considering the setting.\n\nI left for my flight feeling foolish.  I would've been happier with a spicy tuna in a plastic container.

The restaurants are fairly similar.  They both feature very similar decors (sharp reds against dark blacks to give the restaurant a very modern and trendy feel).  Both restaurants also feature bar seating around the open kitchen (a great view of the talented chefs at work).\n\nThere are other similarities.  Both locations feature a lot of modern dishes--whether available as small plates or in a seasonal tasting menu.\n\nThere are differences as well.  The Tokyo location is much bigger.  The Tokyo location also takes pastry very seriously.  The bread at the Vegas location is decent, but it does not compare that well to the Tokyo location.  The Tokyo location even has a high-end patisserie on site, which features upscale French pastries as well as individual cakes/desserts.\n\nThe food was very good at both locations though I probably liked the food at the Vegas location more.  The Tokyo location seemed more representative of the country's cuisine though.  The restaurant featured a lot of Japanese ingredients--whether Japanese fish, Japanese raised beef or mushrooms.  The menu at the Vegas location felt like a menu you might see anywhere.\n\nI went with the tasting menu at the Vegas location and almost everything was very good.  I also added their crispy langoustine as an additional item.  Here is a rundown on their tasting menu.\n\n(Foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan) This was okay though I wish the foie gras taste was stronger.\n\n(Confit of mediterranean vegetables with fresh mint in a radish cannelloni) The flavors were simple and light, but I liked the varying textures and flavors as well as the presentation.\n\n(Poached oysters with chive migonenette) These were good.  The oysters were warm and soft while the dressing was flavorful.\n\n(Langoustines with green curry and coconut milk) These were exceptional.  The langoustines were sweet and very moist (also very soft).  The garnishes were not that strong, which allowed the flavor of the langoustines to really shine.\n\n(White onion tart topped with smoked applewood bacon, quail egg, parmesan, and asparagus) This was kind of a take on breakfast.  I really liked the crispy (hash brown-like) onion tart as well as the rich yolk of the quail egg.  I thought the bacon could have been crispier.\n\n(Crispy langoustine fritter, basil pesto, salad) I ordered this as an additional course.  The crispy shell of the fritter was good--light, crispy and not greasy.  The basil leaf tucked inside the shell also gave the fritter a nice fragrance.  The langoustine was also good (moist), but it did not have the sweetness or softness of the other langoustine dish.\n\n(John Dory, baby leeks, tomato, buttery shellfish sauce with lime and ginger, pomme puree) This was small but good.  The John Dory was moist and light (though the fish still had a good flavor).  I liked the mix of the butter sauce with the creamy, buttery pomme puree and the fresh tomato and leek salsa.\n\n(Foie gras stuffed quail, pomme puree, herb salad with truffle vinaigrette) Though the foie gras stuffing was just okay, the quail was very good.  It was nicely caramelized and had a great sweet and crispy sear as well as juicy meat.  The sauce was rich and good.  I really liked the herb salad--great freshness and fragrant herbs, much better than micro greens (the also strong in flavor truffle vinaigrette was a great pairing).\n\n(Caramel panna cotta, lemon cookie, vanilla ice cream, strawberries) I really liked the panna cotta--smooth and creamy with a very good caramel flavor.  The vanilla ice cream was great--smooth and dense with a great old-fashioned vanilla bean flavor.\n\n(Berry mousse, tender chocolate cake, blackberries, banana tuile) This was a standard fruit with chocolate dessert.  The mousse was creamy and the chocolate cake (pieces) was not dry but just okay.  I really liked the light tuile, which had a noticeable banana flavor.\n\nPrices were high though the tasting menu seemed to be a much better value than going a la carte.\n\nService was decent.  Not super attentive and plates lingered a little bit though the food came out relatively fast.  The staff was pleasant.\n\nL'Atelier de Joel Robuchon features very contemporary and artfully designed food, but there is no sacrifice in flavor.  The restaurant focuses on classical flavor combinations (whether from France or other countries/regions), which should please many.  There are a lot of overpriced fine dining spots in Vegas.  L'Atelier is expensive as well, but at least the food is delicious and very memorable.\n\nMGM Grand offers free self-parking (via a structure).", "business_id": "4uGHPY-OpJN08CabtTAvNg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-02", "type": "review"}

If it's not carts, the absurdly long line to the tax/banking business will block you, too.\n\nAnd prices are hella high here, unless you're deliberately going in for featured items in their circular- how on earth they're charging $12 for a bottle of McCormick's ground cloves, I have no idea.

Subtle!\n\nThe rest of the Hall is also cool with a race shop (not a 'shopping' shop - that's later, this is a 'garage' shop) that lets you experience one of the 18 wheeler \"haulers\" and a pit challenge where you can see what it's like to fuel a race car or jack one up or change the tires!\n\nJumping back to the beginning, I can't recommend enough that you get one of the audio tour guides. Much easier to use than any guide I've seen in my museum experiences (better than the Van Gogh in Amsterdam or the Musee D'Orsay in Paris or the British Museum in London). Just point it at the easily recognizable transponder and listen! A real bargain at $5, it gives some cool background on the artifact you're viewing.\n\nA great experience for kids and grownups, even if you're not in to NASCAR. The whole place is very handicapped accessible too, which I think is a great deal.\n\nOf course, you have to exit through the gift shop. Tshirts, hats, decals, mugs, jackets, key rings, post cards, fridge magnets, even M&M candies (a big NASCAR sponsor). It's all very expensive, but I don't know anywhere else that you can pick up this stuff.\n\nAnd there's my 1400th review, which I dedicate to Tony \"Smoke\" Stewart, who drives the #14 Office Depot/ Burger King Chevy Impala!

I may be getting over-excited about this sweet little coffee house based on the stark difference between it and everything I experience while staying on the strip, but even after a couple of days of consideration, I still am struck by how cool this join is. \n\nFirst off, they have coffee, and it's pretty decent. They also serve real food. Not just pastries, but real food, which always garners favor with me. I appreciate being offered something other than just the usual token pastry case when I'm getting cracked out on coffee. However I didn't try the food here so I can't say how good it is. But it exists, and alongside the decent coffee, authentic atmosphere and fast wifi, it completes a package. \n\nMore on the atmosphere - this joint sits in the Emergency Arts building, which houses a bunch of cool little gallery spaces harboring fun, funky art. Most weren't open when I visited but I did peek through some windows and could see myself wanting to return to see what the local hip arts community is up to. There's also a large selection of vinyl in the space, and you can peruse (and even play?) records there while you're sippin' on joe. Very cool. \n\nThe staff? Friendly. \n\nI'm super, duper glad I decamped from my situation at chain-coffee ground-zero and sought out some realness.

It felt intimate and not too crowded. The lighting was low, and the space was warm and charming. A great go-to date spot. Service was great. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, and we were well taken care of.\n\nPostino is more a wine bar than a full sit-down restaurant, with reasonably priced bottles and a menu that consists of large format antipasti and paninis. We ordered a bottle of Canto Sur, a red blend of mostly cabernet and carmenere. You can get wines by the glass here, but the bottle prices are only three times the glass prices, putting most of the bottles in the high twenties/low thirties range. We were happy with the wine. We also ordered a few antipasti and tried to order paninis for our dinner when our waitress stopped us--she said what we thought were antipastis would fill us up plenty, and she was absolutely right.\n\nGranted, we were planning to order a pretty big spread of appetizers. We shared the butcher's block, the pub board, and a selection of four bruschetta. Did not realize that each of these boards would be gigantic. Everything was delicious. The butcher's block came with plenty of meat--prosciutto, coppa, salami, and peppered salami--along with goat cheese and white bean hummus. There was crostini, of course, and a huge assortment of great accompaniments--olives, dried cranberries, almonds, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, smoked yellow tomatoes, and three kinds of pickle.The pub board brought another huge spread, this one of MJ's soft pretzels, Scrheiner's chorizo, cornichons, aged cheddar, and giant Spanish corn nuts. It was fun to mix and match everything on these boards, and it was all fantastic. The bruschetta seems to be the main draw of Postino, but I didn't understand why until our selection arrived. We opted to order four of them for $14, and were expecting bruschetta sized like bruschetta. These were more like full-on flatbreads, with the four bruschetta adding up to about a pizza in volume. We had the tomato jam and fresh sheep's milk cheese, the salami with pesto, the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, and the burrata, bacon, arugula, and tomato. Not a dud in the bunch--loved all the meat, and the tangy cheese with the sweet tomato jam was perfect on its own.\n\nWe took great pleasure in our feast of antipasti and wine.

Having consumed ~$100 between two at Bouchon Bakery in NYC back in June, my expectations entering Bouchon Bistro on the 10th floor of the Venetian were high....at least 10 stories high.\n\nDue to their rustic simplicity and historic preparation by poor persons utilizing limited ingredients, I personally believe gnocchi/dumplings (along with Bread Pudding) to be the ultimate foods by which to judge a chef and knowing that my time in Vegas would be limited, I e-mailed ahead approximately 2 weeks early and asked if it would be possible for the chef to prepare the Gnocchi a la Parisienne during the weekday breakfast hours.  While an odd request for sure, my e-mail was almost immediately answered by General Manager Andy St. John who stated the chef would be delighted to prepare the meal during the day at no additional costs, no questions asked.  Gnocchi for breakfast?  Well, kinda...\n\nArriving at Bouchon around 7:30 I checked in with the host who introduced me to dining manager Robert who took me to my seat, indoors looking out at the pool given the bright sun and my fare skin.  Water was delivered and I was given a few moments to browse the restaurant before my server returned.  The simple bistro layout, the open doors to the pool and garden, the fresh smell of the baking breads....lovely.  When Robert returned specials were discussed, despite already knowing my strange request, and I settled on a starter of the Chocolate Almond Croissant and a cup (make that about 6 cups) of coffee.  See, the croissant was Breakfast...the Gnocchi just followed closely.\n\nThe croissant, like all of Keller's pastries, was magical...the best croissant I've ever had in terms of flavor.  Crispy and warm on the outside with chocolate drizzle and copious almonds, plus a flaky interior and a thick layer of chocolate gnache folded into the flaky dough and then loaded with chopped almonds.  If I lived close to a Bouchon this would be a very frequent indulgence to say the least.  The coffee...thick, robust, french pressed...the best priced cup of coffee in Vegas for sure.\n\nA couple more coffee refills and it was time for the main course (consumed with water, not coffee.)  Without further ado, I will just say that this dish redefined gnocchi in all ways.  Unlike Italian gnocchi, the French style utilized butter in the noodles along with the potatoes and the effect literally creates a dumpling that melts on the tongue.  Every single piece appeared hand crafted, perfectly tender on the outside, yet toothsome and textural on the outside.  The dish was complimented with carrots, spinach, mushrooms fricassee and beurre noisette as dressing and the entire effect was simply perfection on a plate.  I honestly cannot think of the last time it took me so long to savor each bite of a dish, but by all accounts I believe I ate each piece individually, slowly.  Such simple ingredients, such flawless execution.  \n\nCertainly I love foie gras, blue lobster, diver scallops, and desserts considered to be delicacies, but I also appreciate when simplicity yields perfection.  While I've not been to French Laundry or Per Se, both will have their time in the sun in the near future...but for now I will simply state that if it is the little things that count, Bouchon is doing ALL the little things right from superior service to setting to food.  After breakfast I made my second of four visits during the trip to Bouchon Bakery for a carry-along snack...two days later I returned to Bouchon for Brunch, my only repeat of the trip....yes, it was that impressive.", "business_id": "tFU2Js_nbIZOrnKfYJYBBg", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-09-29", "type": "review"}

Having already dined at Joel Robuchon twice myself this was not the first time I'd seen such generosity from the kitchen of \"The Chef of the Century\" and much like my previous visits the meal was an exercise in refinement; the room, the food, and the service all well-manicured, highly polished, and lavish.\n\nTaking a 9:00pm reservation and arriving early only to be identified by name as the doors swung open on my approach I was subsequently seated at the same table I'd dined at during my first visit and greeted by a familiar service team including the same dining room manager and server as my prior visit much of what would follow was familiar; the plethoric bread cart and equally impressive cheese course followed by a dessert trolley with nearly three dozen options plus the signature pound cake, though this time smaller than prior.  Deferring on coffee I was additionally treated to a hand clipped tea and infusions cart and a $10 flat charge brought no less than three bottles of Evian - no doubt the cost of admission warrants these things as well as the impressive \"Ruby\" palate cleanser and \"Maize\" amuse - gifts that would constitute proper courses at many restaurants.\n\nMoving on to what was ordered I once again opted to order from the prix fixe as opposed to the larger grand tasting and making a special request for the (menu price $300 if ordered ALC) Pintade Fermiere my only small complaint regarding the entire evening was that Chef Le Tohic felt need to visit my table before the hen's preparation to suggest I'd be better off only ordering half the bird as I'd have gladly (and greedily,) eaten more of the crispy skin and supple flesh sandwiched around thick, buttery, foie gras...though I guess saving the $60 supplement charge was a benefit.\n\nTruffles, foie gras, uni, foie gras, caviar, and more foie gras plus aged comte, spell-binding desserts, and a room and service beyond reproach I can think of much worse ways to celebrate Christmas Eve than with Joel Robuchon's team at the MGM and although I personally would never do so in a T-shirt there is something refreshing about the fact that in a city where there are so many bad high-stakes bets this is a place where anyone willing and able to spend the money is virtually guaranteed an excellent return.", "business_id": "wfofFm3AqtyK_ujNQ893mQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-05-25", "type": "review"}

Most of these restaurants feel and look the same as they did 10 years ago (a lot of them have the same menu items from 10 years ago).  That being said, these celebrity chef restaurants must be doing well because they are still standing today.  The Bellagio is a great example of this.  When is the last time a new restaurant opened there?\n\nI think one of the Venetian's / Palazzo's celebrity chef restaurants did not make it though--the space I think that used to hold French bistro Pinot Brasserie has been replaced with another celebrity chef backed French bistro db Brasserie.  This hotel has several French bistros--Morels and Bouchon in addition to this new entry from New York chef Daniel Boulud.\n\ndb Brasserie has a nice look.  It is not cluttered or old-fashioned.  It is a nice and simple room that is contemporary but also elegant with white tablecloth.  db Brasserie is very close to the gaming floor, but it is also next to the pathway that leads to the convention space and other restaurants so it is not too loud.\n\nLike many restaurants at The Venetian and Palazzo, db Brasserie is open for lunch and dinner.  I tried it for lunch.  Their lunch menu is fairly expensive, but they also offer a reasonably priced 3-course lunch pre fixe menu and the short rib tagliatelle entree featured in that 3-course menu looked delicious.\n\nI did not opt for the 3-course option but instead had a starter and one of their pastas in a starter size.  My starter was King crab wrapped in cucumber and garnished with melon.  Overall, it was an okay starter--light and refreshing.  Unfortunately, despite the presence of black garlic and yuzu vinaigrette, the dish was a tad on the bland side.  The King crab was also minced up too much, which was a shame since the crab would have been much more satisfying as well as much more indicative of King crab if the kitchen would have presented the crab in thick chunks.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/db-brasserie-las-vegas-2?select=ykoIxC-DJuEJcjoa3uKT9g#bKR-dezvvN38zq5uc9kJ6g\n\nIn addition, while the melon was fine, the melon did not reveal the juiciness or sweetness of melon I've had at California restaurants serving melon in the summer like Ad Hoc in Yountville or Republique in LA.  High quality produce and freshness are where a lot of Vegas restaurants fall short and that was the case here.\n\nMy entree was a linguini with lemon, shrimp, clams, bottarga, and arugula.  The pasta was nicely seasoned with a light butter sauce that had a fair amount of heat.  Unfortunately, the linguini was too soft.  None of the shellfish stood out either.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/db-brasserie-las-vegas-2?select=ykoIxC-DJuEJcjoa3uKT9g#TZx2Je0qQuOLHn1xAfIGZQ\n\nI was happy to find out that db Brasserie features a good variety of desserts for both dinner and lunch; there were even some freshly prepared desserts like warm Madeleines.  The Madeleines were very similar to the ones they serve at Daniel.  Daniel's Madelienes were better though because the contrast between a lightly crisp exterior and a soft interior stood out more there; still, the Madeleines here were nicely sweet, warm, soft, and satisfying.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/db-brasserie-las-vegas-2?select=ykoIxC-DJuEJcjoa3uKT9g#gxsSo0qXKcfnKfiJG1bhjw\n\nTheir profiteroles were stuffed with good caramel-coffee gelato, but the profiterole (choux) pastry was too crisp and meringue like.  The profiteroles were topped with whipped cream and a thin dark chocolate sauce.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/db-brasserie-las-vegas-2?select=ykoIxC-DJuEJcjoa3uKT9g#kzzVKiu6biP1aTLqrK5FPg\n\nThe black and white fondant did not unleash the molten chocolate center that was promised, but it was still rich, chocolatey and warm.  The cake came with verbena ice cream on the side.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/db-brasserie-las-vegas-2?select=ykoIxC-DJuEJcjoa3uKT9g#FW58V6SdrqYhdJYIHMFv2w\n\nAs mentioned, prices are high, but their 3-course lunch menu allows you to dine here and not spend a ridiculous amount of money.\n\nService was okay to poor.  On one visit, service was efficient but not very friendly.  On another visit, the food took way too long to come out despite the restaurant not being that busy.\n\ndb Brasserie is an okay French bistro, but you would be much better off heading to Bouchon if you are spending a weekend here.  Bouchon is open for weekend brunch though it is not open for a full lunch service on weekdays.  db Brasserie has all the French bistro dishes, but they just do not deliver plates of food with the quality that many would probably expect given that db Brasserie is a Daniel Boulud restaurant.\n\nLike most hotels on The Strip, The Venetian / Palazzo offers complimentary self and valet parking.", "business_id": "KcWUgvyl64Vp0PfwQRZQkw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-09-08", "type": "review"}

Having heard of the nearly decade old establishment owned and operated by Matt Pool during my first visit to Phoenix but unable to make it downtown before ten on any day during that trip (when lines reportedly top two hours despite triple digit temperatures) I have to admit that I really had not anticipated the line to be so long at 6:55am and for a moment I contemplated heading elsewhere, but with my books in hand and nothing better to do my curiosity won out and I added my name to the paper list and took a seat in the rapidly dissipating shade.\n\nSitting and reading while a pair of ASU students talked about having seen Matt's on (presumably a repeat) of Diners, Dives, and Drive-Ins the previous night I tried to ignore them (and Guy Fiere's existence in general) while a few people trickled out of the restaurant and with my name at least ten parties down on the list I was surprised when it was called - the solo diner benefit, it seems, landing me an end seat on the counter only fifteen minutes after I arrived and given the expedient service at Matt's a fortuitous happening that had me leaving the restaurant before the aforementioned students had even entered the doors.\n\nSeated at the counter with a menu I'd already memorized in hand and a daily special that held little interest I perused the interior - small, stark, but efficient and exceptionally clean - before my server filled my water glass, offered me coffee, and fielded a pair of questions prior to taking my order and handing it over to the kitchen less than five feet away.  With the space tight and my location literally on the verge of the kitchen and the pass it would not be long before my coffee was filled - a single pour that I subsequently sent back due to a combination of thin mouth-feel, acrid flavor, and no artificial sweetener - and even less time before my stool would be bumped into for the first of thirty times...to say the least this is not a place I'd choose to linger.\n\nSeated and watching the action of the kitchen as plate after plate came through the window and regular after regular chatted with Matt's wife at the cash register it would not be long before my order would arrive and with the restaurant's strong dedication to local/organic/fresh sourcing the items that were presented quickly made me realize why so many people deal with long waits and less-than-comfortable seating to experience Matt's Big Breakfast - the food is really quite excellent, beginning first with a perfect hotcake served with pure maple syrup and far too much (or perhaps just the right amount of) butter for $2.75.\n\nMoving from the dainty golden flapjack to something more substantial, my second dish would actually consist of two plates and four items in the form of \"The Chop & Chick\" - an $8.95 breakfast comprised of a Pan Seared Iowa Pork Rib Chop with 2 Poached Eggs, Hash Browns, and Whole grain Toast with Blueberry Rhubarb Jam.  Apparently their most 'famous' dish it is a little difficult to decide which aspect of the plate was the best considering the quality of perfectly poached eggs (something even good restaurants tend to overcook,) crisp yet buttery potatoes and lightly herbed juicy pork chop but in the end I think I would have to give the nod to the toast - hand cut thick, rife with seeds and a rich earthiness, and topped with house made preserves featuring what seemed to be no sugar at all but rather the essence of blueberries with a slight savoriness from the rhubarb...a strong contender for best jam/preserves I've ever encountered and reason enough to revisit Matt's when it moves to its new digs a few doors down (and hopefully decreases wait times and seat bumps...and perhaps finds a coffee roaster whose beans better compliment the quality of the food.)", "business_id": "ntN85eu27C04nwyPa8IHtw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-12", "type": "review"}

I ran the 5k on Saturday night (as my warm up) and the half on Sunday night. Race packet pick up was located at the Convention Center. OH MAN! I have never been in such a crowd. We went right at 10am and there was already a long line to get in. I haven't never been to an expo with this many people at a RNR event. I wanted so much to walk the booths, but it was so crowded, we left after 30 mins. The booths were so packed and it was so hard to maneuver through the crowds. One positive is that parking was free; however, good luck getting in and out of the parking lot. NO TRAFFIC CONTROL!\n\n5K:\nLocated at the new SLS casino. Fiancee and I drove to SLS early to ensure we got a parking space before the roads closed. We walked over to the start of the race - parking lot next to SLS - and took pics and waited for the start. The weather was perfect. In fact, it was pretty warm. I wore a tank and booty shorts. There were so many people that the fiancee didn't even see me at the start line to take my photo passing through. It was 530p and dark, mind you! We ran a bit of the strip and on the side roads. There were a couple of potholes, so had to be mindful where you were running. Quick run - easy peasy. We opted to stay and eat at SLS for dinner and ended up at the bar. There was an after-party in the lot where the finish was but we wanted real grub and beer! \n\nHalf marathon: \nOverall, it was a good experience to fun the Strip. It was weird not seeing traffic on the strip or cars for that matter! First of all, it was cold. Blistering cold!!! Total change in weather from the night before. Disappointed that Snoop bailed as the opening act, and even though I like Macklemore, it was just too cold to watch!!! We parked at MGM Grand so that we can park close to the start line and carb load. Bad choice. We should have parked closer to the end of the strip by Mandalay! Oh well... We walked a ways to get to the start. So many corrals! I think I saw about 50. This is the largest race I have ever been in. Crazy!!! So the first several miles were cool - LV lights, the crowds, the cheers, awesomeness. Then you get to the real downtown and you see a lot of wedding chapels, pawn shops and liquor stores. When I  thought that was the worst of it, we ended up on some weird and dark side streets. I was actually scared running through the area for a minute. More lights needed! Then we get back on the strip and by mile 10 my fingers were frozen. It had gotten so cold that people were slowing down. It was horrible!!! Perhaps the race should start a little earlier?! At the finish, you would have to walk down about a quarter miles just to get out of the finishing area to meet up with your friends and family. Pretty crazy... The finish was at the Mirage but to leave the area, you would need to go all the way past Cesar's Palace. We stayed at Treasure Island and so we had to walk all the way back up from Cesars. I was miserable!!! My joints and bones were frozen by the end of the race and all I wanted to do is eat, shower and sleep!!!\n\nAgain great experience and awesome to do it once, but would I do it again?!

The drinks were great and the shots servers were super friendly. The folks who partied around us were real friendly. They were real social and everyone was in good spirits. I loved that the photographer took a bunch of photos of my b-day celebration group. That made the night even more fun and memorable. The rushing waterfall was beautiful and was perfect as it provided the packed, super hot and thumping venue with a light misty breeze. This is an awesome venue.

Us girls just got dropped off by our crazy taxi man in front of Planet Hollywood, and the guy up front tells us to go to Prive.

So one of us tells him well go escort us then so he takes us all the way up past the crowds, up the elevators, and we're in there like *bam*.  I had to later get a mysterious stranger up there too, so we go down to pick him and his friend up and do get them through the crowds, only with some added flirtation and what not with the guys workin' it.  We get them in but they still have to pay $30 (but it's Vegas?).\n\nThe second time I went here I hollered at the lady who gave me her card (btw, don't buy those tickets they sell on the streets.

The separation helped me avoid any situations where I might have to explain myself after \"accidentally\" kicking some child who's not yet mentally capable of recognizing the unspoken but agreed upon social flow of the marketplace, and over all kept the babies and their P's out of my impatient hair though there was at least one mother(f*cker) who thought the busy and crowded market was the perfect place to teach her 10-month old how to walk, and for that I mentally sentenced her to death by antique steam-punk firing squad... which conveniently there was a booth for. \n\nThere were a few really neat vendors but because it seemed like most or all were to limited to their area of one standard-size folding table and the space behind it. I don't think shops were able to display too many items and I'm going to assuming that because of the table-size limitation. Vendors had to pick and choose a limited variety of stock to bring/display and that caused a lot of the vendors inventory to look really mis-matched and random. As an example, it seemed pretty par for the course to see one single vendor selling art prints of movie stills, knit owl barrettes and steam-punk business card holders, and while I'm sure there's a market for all of those things, there was a disconnection in the goods that translated to making the table look less desirable.\n\nOn the other hand, because vendors had just a single table space and not an area where they could create a store cubby type nook with multiple tables and curtains, there was no getting grid-locked into a booth and not being able to get in or out or even see the goods. You were able to walk straight through the three main aisles and pretty clearly see what kind of stuff each vendor offered without having to squish in and fight for a spot to view the table, which was really nice and saved a lot of time, though it did mean that each shopper spent less time looking at a vendor's goods than the cubby/nook mock storefront way where you sort of get sucked in and trapped in into looking more and buying more. \n\nMy favorite booths were the craft beer candles that smelled fantastic and were in old glass beer bottle that had been sawed in half and smoothed over as well as the super crowded jewelry vendor in the very back. I ended up getting (or being gifted by a very special someone) this bullet necklace I'd been eyeing. \n\nThis market was great because while the shopping was all indoor, there was a beer tent outside, a hula hoop station (also a vendor) and multiple local restaurants had brought their goods and set up shop to grill on the plaza outside the market. And while everything smelled like delicious, smoky heaven, the lines were wrapping around the nearby businesses so we opted to wait it out and grab food elsewhere. \n\nI would definitely recommend I made it market to anyone with an urge to shop local and an hour or so to kill. It's not a destination or all day type thing, but it's a great mix of quality craft and the community, as well as being far from any super boring Holly Hobby church craft fair type thing. Check it out when it's in town. It's totally free to attend and fun way to spend an afternoon with friends, fam, kids or just yourself.", "business_id": "ik3VPGhaJ0sKCa2plKyVoQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-07", "type": "review"}

That being said, I still enjoyed everything I did get!\n\nBF and I worked hard moving into our new apartment and worked up an appetite- rushed to Heidi's for sustenance. We each got a sandwich and swapped halves to share: the Transplanted New Yorker on marble rye was his choice while the Salmon Melt on french was mine. Both came with pickles and cups of potato salad. \nI'm not a big spice fan but the NY was a good kind of spicy- it snuck up on you! Each bite started out mild and built up in eat for a spicy aftertaste. Bread was soft, meat was plentiful, and the avocado was a nice creamy touch.\nThe Salmon Melt was delish- I'm picky about warm salmon (I prefer it as sashimi) but the flavors were spot on. Add in the spicy cajun sauce and it had a good kick to it that added the much-needed \"extra something\" that a lot of salmon sandwiches lack.\n\nThe pickle was a great bit of cool flavor after the spicy sandwiches, and the potato salad was with red potatoes- which is so much better than regular mustard/mayo potato salad. Red potatoes make the salad so much better, no clue why. Maybe it's all in my head.\n\nIn any case, the sandwiches are effing huge- the half sandwich lunch combo would be a perfect meal, but with the half-and-half swap the BF and I did, neither of us completely finished. Which is a good thing. I could only manage about 3/4ths of each and it's the only meal I ate for the day. \nThe meal for both of us, with tax, came to a total of $20- awesome pricing for phenomenal portion sizes, great value.\n\nAlso worth a mention? The staff is badass. Super friendly and polite, cool guys. Had recommendations and suggestions, and even offered to make a half pastrami and half corned beef sandwich for the BF in the future.

BF has zero interest in this kind of thing, so I flew solo.\n\nHadn't been to the Luxor before, was easy to find parking and then the theater. Lines for box office and entrance went fast, was seated in the middle orchestra, about ten rows back.\n\nShow itself was very entertaining- several different musical styles and dance styles were showcased, everything perfectly synchronized. I have no idea how much they must practice to get everything so perfectly spot-on; and this coming from a former dancer. There are at least 14 people in the show, so it's a surprisingly large cast. I found that I enjoyed the routines that had the larger groups, just because there were always so many different things going on at once.\n\nThe underlying plot for this show is very vague, you don't really need to be following along in order to enjoy it. The show length clocks in just under 90 minutes and it's a good length before things start to get boring. Most parts of the show are fairly energizing, and there's a good amount of audience participation- which I personally could do without, actually, but apparently other people enjoy that sort of thing.\n\nI enjoyed the parts of the show that involved the Harlem Shake and Party Rock Anthem- though they are dated at this point.  I could do without the Bohemian Rhapsody part, but I guess the song is popular all these decades later for a reason... allegedly. Regardless, this group does a great job of coordinating their dance moves to the music and to one another, in a way that manages to create a distinct personality for each member of the extensive cast despite virtually no dialogue and the fact that they are identically clothed and masked- quite a feat.\n\nFavorite part is, of course, the end, when they take off their masks for a mere moment- gotta say, part of me is really bummed that they don't have a girl on the team.

I suggested that we just leave and perhaps go eat somewhere else later since we had filled our tummies some and weren't about to keel over in hunger.\n\nIt was cheap as usual for dim sum, but then again, every dim sum place in Vegas has cheap dim sum and we've had better and we've had worse.", "business_id": "Xnwjo2TUu4AyGdmsxeG7OQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-12-28", "type": "review"}

She said it was very good.\n\nWe all tried the Strawberry Longcake...which is divine!  It's a Strawberry Cake fused with Ice Cream and Strawberries and topped with Strawberry Drizzle, fresh Strawberries, and Whipped Cream.  Wow, this surprised us and blew us away.

When I told her I was dining in, she handed me a menu and told me I could sit anywhere in the restaurant.\n\nAfter browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided on the Italian Sub (Ham, Capricole, Genoa Salami, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, and Provolone Cheese) $10.50....came with Fries, Cole Slaw, and Pickle.  I also ordered a side of Jalapenos, in case I wanted to add some kick to it.\n\nWhile I waited for my food, I looked around the joint.  There are beverage coolers in the front of the Deli that had Sodas & Bottled Water.  I was tempted to buy a bottle of Dr. Browns Natural Soda, but after reading the label I decided against it because it said \"Sugar/High Fructose Corn Syrup\".....how is that \"natural\"?  I'm trying to avoid HFCS, so I passed and got a bottle of Water.  They also have Bagels & Pastries available for purchase.....they looked tempting (see pics), but I wanted to wait until after I had my Sandwich to decide if I would do Dessert.\n\nAfter a few minutes my Sandwich came out.  The thing was piled high with Meat!  (see pics) I wasn't expecting this....I had to remove some of it before I ate the Sandwich, just so I could take a bite.  After a few bites, I realized that it was a pretty dry Sandwich.....so I asked for Mayo & Mustard.  I added a little of both and it still lacked something....so I took the Cole Slaw and put it in the Sandwich....ahh, much better!  The Sandwich by itself was too dry and lacked the flavor of really good Italian Sandwiches....at least to me.\n\nThe Fries were pre-fab Crinkle Fries.....pretty bland, had to add Salt.  They weren't that good.  The Cole Slaw very excellent, not too runny or sweet and had a nice crunch to it, which I like.  The Pickle was eh....I've had better.\n\nOverall, it was a OK experience.

He enjoyed the great Japanese Director, Akira Kurosawa, because they were both inspired by their own dream worlds, and Fellini influenced, by their own admissions, great international directors like Ingmar Bergman, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorcese and Bernado Bertolucci. \n\nHe is considered by many one of the 10 best directors of all time. One of his characters in La Dolce Vita, named Paparazzo, who took pictures, inspired the term Paparazzi.\n\nThis Fellini's isn't a legend like Frederico was, but it is a solid Italian restaurant in the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino. The prices, for Vegas, are reasonable, and the food is tasty and well done if not extraordinary and memorable. \n\nThe Carpaccio ($12.95) was nice, with capers, dry cheese, olive oil and arugula; the Angel Hair pasta with Rapini ($18.95) was very good and a lot of food; the Fettucine Capri was enough for 2 with a nice sauce that was in between a cream and a tomato base. Garden Salad was $6.95.  A nice Ruffino Reserve red wine ($37.00) added to the enjoyment of the food, and the Tira Misu ($6.95) was classic and light.\n\nService was good, although Steve, the best server, was off that day. \n\nInside this Fellini's, you can get a good reliable Italian meal, unlike an unpredictable, wild and crazy, sexually charged Fellini Film.

Having already visited the Pizzeria, Pane, and Italian Restaurant for lunch myself this was my first dinner at a Bianco restaurant and arriving to find the space bustling we opted to sit outdoors in order to avoid the noise; a big mistake that instead led to both captain and a server named Adam largely ignoring us throughout the evening as water went unfilled, dishes were dropped off without description, ingredient questions required further investigation with the kitchen, and epic delays occurred between each course, plate pickup, and particularly drop-off and collection of desserts along with the check.\n\nMoving past service issues, the food was every bit as good as the first visit, the housemade pastas and bread clearly a strong point while fresh local produce shined in a salad with bright, bold vinaigrette and beets sweeter than almost any I'd previously encountered.  Unfortunately replacing my all-time favorite corn and pancetta gnocchi with a slightly more seasonal version featuring brown butter and sage the dumplings themselves once again melted in the mouth while the crespelle, a crepe stuffed to bursting with creamy cheese and bitter escarole, topped with Bianco's signature sauce was rustic, simple, and  perfect - just the way Italian food should be and just the way Chris and his team make it at each of their restaurants.", "business_id": "BPi1Q5wX0_o5VlO_XRyYuQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-05-26", "type": "review"}

Not a steak eater, the choice may seem a tad unusual until one realizes that this was now my fourth Emeril restaurant and fourth time I'd be sampling his take on Shrimp and Bread Pudding.  To be fair, I find it unfortunate that so many people consider Emeril a \"sell-out\" because he is on TV....he is still a good cook with some great recipes and one of the few celeb chefs who actually keeps his restaurants open for lunch along with dinner.  \n\nOn first impression, Delmonico seems rather boring in design.  A front bar/lounge and a back dining room with mostly whites and woods - Elegant but \"home-y\" would be the best way to describe it, yet slightly odd with the single spotlights peering down on each table.  Arriving around 1:45 I was toward the end of lunch hour, but was seated immediately at a four top in the front.  \n\nThe menu and bread were delivered swiftly, yet despite my knowing exactly what I wanted it took 15 minutes before the waiter returned for my order.  Creamy BBQ Shrimp with Fresh Baked Rosemary Biscuit, please.  \n\nOrder placed, I was given \"bread\" and \"butter\" from a side serving table....the bread was cool and dry while the butter was a block of ice....poor form.\n\nUnchecked upon until the arrival of my shrimp around 2:30pm, I sat and listened to the table behind me and took some pictures.  Thankfully, when my meal did arrive, the Chef's cooking once again spoke volumes.  7 huge shrimp, 3 small rosemary biscuits, and a sauce that can only be described as a mixture of honey, hickory, and cream with a slight bit of spice....it was lovely.  With all the shrimp finished and significant sauce left over, I requested more bread and this time was \nthankfully brought two piping hot rolls glistening with butter.  While these were delicious and used for mopping up the sauce, it does not excuse the awful first bread service.\n\nWith my main gone a different waiter appeared and asked if I'd like dessert.  Darn right I said, having sampled 3 of Emeril's Bread Puddings in the past (one of them twice....we actually went back to Emeril's of Orlando for Bread Pudding after the version at Emeril's Tchoup Chop disappointed....not that I'm obsessed with bread pudding or anything.)  On the menu at Delmonico?  Banana Bread Pudding w/ Oreo Ice Cream.  \n\nServed in a tiny pot, the moist and liquidy Banana Bread was fantastic, yet so hot that it had turned the ice cream into a melting puddle before it even arrived.  The icecream itself was pretty standard fare and didn't really compliment nor detract from the pudding.  Having had Banana Bread Pudding twice in the past, this was the worst of the three and nowhere near as good as the Sweet Potato Bread Pudding at Emeril's Fish House or the Bourbon Cinnamon version at Citywalk Orlando.  As many have noted before, Vegas seems to have a thing for runny bread pudding, yet the three best I've tried in Vegas have all been the more dry version.  \n\nAll told, the shrimp was truly standout while all other aspects of the meal were pretty average....and the cold bread....poor poor from.  From what I've heard the steaks here are delicious and I'd certainy return to sample other menu items, but given the vast number of Vegas choices (and two better Emeril restaurants, IMO) I doubt I'll be back.", "business_id": "YacTpiq0ZptFcXD7I-kdGA", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-09-29", "type": "review"}

Rarely impressed by potatoes but finding the crispy 'jazz' fries quite addicting as I chatted with the team about the upcoming \"art, music, and entertainment\" it was just prior to noon when my final plate arrived and with both duck and pork crispy yet supple beneath a touch of acid-sweet sauce I immediately swooned, a $12 plate worth the drive from Spring Mountain to The Strip as opposed to the other way around.", "business_id": "bdsKG7MQIMmZ73lgOaTZ0A", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-05-26", "type": "review"}

Focusing on the few items that at least worked in parts, the red velvet far outdid the funfetti and 'breakfast' options by presenting moist cake and tangy cream cheese frosting while both tarts, though far too sweet to let natural fruits shine, presented a respectable buttery crust that in more restrained hands could produce a great seasonal pie.   Speaking last to macarons, the general quality of most I've tasted in Las Vegas lacking, I would strongly recommend those preferring jam based centers take a look here as both cookies featured good crackle giving way to a quickly dissipating crumb over intense filling, the apple again a bit saccharine but the strawberry like an early bite of summer...two great bites amidst a $25 tab quoted off the top of the clerk's head without any listed prices or detailed receipt, none of it a reason to return even given the proximity as I've produced better versions of all but the macarons in my own kitchen.", "business_id": "_F_6tiqmQoAupzlhp-7M5Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-02-17", "type": "review"}

Most of the eggs are poached to perfection and the toppings make for a nice kick in the overall flavor, they just need more potatoes to soak up some of that yolk. \n\nFeel like going the traditional route? Try their regular platters and enjoy the egg-y names like the egg-chilada, (an ode to a Mexican eggs style i.e. huevos a la Mexicana), egg-stravaganza (french toast platter), oy-vegg (Jewish style breakfast), egg-CITEment (strawberry flambe + eggs), and many more creative naming schemes. What matters is the food is simple and certainly brunch fulfilling, even if there are few items under $10.\n\nIn the end, this place is just a glorified Denny's with a special emphasis on eggs.

I finally decided to give it a try when I was in the area recently.  The name is kind of misleading.....I was expecting a sit-down restaurant with table service, what I found was a Coffee Shop (a la Starbucks), except it's locally owned.  I was a little disappointed because I had built up a huge appetite and the menu was very limited.\n\nAfter a few minutes I decided to get their Cheese Pannini.  When I arrived, there was only 1 person in front of me, so I thought the service was going to be fast.....it wasn't.  It took almost 15 minutes to make my Paninni.....which for a sit-down restaurant wouldn't be bad, but for an order at the counter type place, it's kind of a long time.  I arrived just before the lunch rush (11:30 am)....while I was waiting, it got very busy with 10 people in line or so.  They are single threaded here with their food preparation, so I can't imagine how long they will have to wait for their food.\n\nAnyway, when my food came out, it looked great.  I couldn't wait to take a bite of the Paninni.  It was as good as it looked, very good!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA?select=iM-bmUJgFX3I3lpLT57uTQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA?select=E2YbzDiWAomUXZQu3VtjSw\nThe Tomato Sauce in the Paninni was great and full of flavor.  The Bread was very tasty too.  The Paninni came with a very small side of greens which also went well with the dish.  I wish there were more greens.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience.  However, for those with large appetites, I wouldn't suggest it....the portions are too small and ordering two Paninnis wouldn't be cost effective.  The joint is situated between a bunch of office buildings and is suited more for that crowd than a casual diner.  The staff is very nice here and makes a sincere attempt and getting to know their guests.  They asked me what my name was and where I was from, where I heard about the place, etc.....and they knew several of the people who stopped by for lunch by their 1st name....I'm guessing by the way they were dressed that they worked in one of the buildings nearby.\n\nReturn Factor - 30%", "business_id": "OHsuvX4rmhnPvvRBb-QK7A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-02", "type": "review"}

With steakhouses, the first thing people want to know is if the steak is good.  The steak here was very good (some of the best I've had).  Of course, a lot of these high-end steakhouses put out good quality steaks that are cooked to the appropriate temperature.  They tend to struggle with the other menu items though--the starters, sides and desserts.  Unfortunately, Carnevino is too similar to other steakhouses in that respect.\n\nCarnevino is huge and boisterous.  They keep the restaurant pretty dark.  The decor is nice and the seating is comfortable, but the overall look and design of the restaurant is nothing new (or impactful).  They do feature a large bronze bull statue at the front.\n\nThe complimentary bread included cheese puffs that were good.  I cannot remember what other bread was served, but it was at least okay.\n\nI started with the big eye tuna crudo, which featured tuna sashimi dressed in a vinaigrette with a side of radish and cucumber salad.  The tuna was fresh and good though it was a very small portion.  Some of it was a little over salted.  The radish and cucumber salad was fresh and crisp.\n\nFor my pasta, I had the fruit di mare, which featured spaghetti with a tomato sauce, lobster, squid, shrimp, and clams.  The seafood was a generous portion.  I liked the lobster and the shrimp.  The squid was fine.  The clams were just okay; I've had better.  The clams here were not as meaty and tender as I would have liked.  There was a little bit of grit and sand in some of the shellfish though.\n\nThe tomato sauce had a little bit of heat to it, but it was quite thin, watery and bland.  The waiter said that all of their pastas were housemade, but the spaghetti did not taste like housemade spaghetti.  Maybe it was, but I have had better housemade spaghetti at other restaurants.\n\nI tried my friend's pappardelle dish, which was served with mushrooms.  We both agreed that her pasta was a little bland.  The texture of the pasta was good though.  I was not a fan of the pastas at Batali's Osteria Mozza (though the pastas there were not bland but salty).\n\nThe main course was good though.  I had a bone-in New York Strip and it had a great char to it.  The inside was nicely medium rare.  It was juicy, flavorful and tender (which is hard to do with a New York Strip because it is lean).\n\nThey also offer a dry aged bone-in ribeye for two people.  This ribeye gives new meaning to the word bone-in (check the photos on Yelp to see what I mean).  The ribeye was huge and they carve it tableside.  The ribeye was very good--great marbling, juicy, flavorful, and tender (one of the best steaks I've had).\n\nI also sampled a little bit of the filet portion from the porterhouse.  This was my least favorite of the steaks.  Maybe the filet was too thick because the center of it was kind of bland.\n\nThey offer sauces on the side and I tried their wine reduction (Barolo Ristretto), which was oily and had no flavor.\n\nI did not get to try many of the sides, but I did try their creamy mashed potatoes (mixed with mascarpone and a poached egg).  The mashed potatoes were very creamy and flavorful.  The other sides sounded good.\n\nIt was my friend's birthday so Carnevino made a big chocolate cake for the occasion.  The chocolate cake was rich and fudgy, but it was just okay.  We also had some of their gelato on the side (chocolate, vanilla and coffee).  The gelato was a little icy and lacked the creamy, smooth texture that is common with gelato.  The flavors were not that prominent as well.\n\nService was good.  Food came out at a good pace.  We were a large party, but they had a large and attentive staff supporting us.  Before ordering at most restaurants, I engage the server to understand what are the most popular dishes and how are they prepared.  More often than not, I let the server direct me in what to order especially if I sense the server is passionate about the food.  Here though, the waiter was a little pushy.  As soon as we sat down, he was directing us on what to order, how much we need to order and so forth.  Service was still good, but the waiter was just not for me.\n\nCarnevino's meat was very good and unlike several Las Vegas restaurants I've dined at, I walked away satisfied.  Prices here (like other Vegas restaurants) were pretty steep, but at least I felt that the main food here (steak) would match up well with some of the other very good steak places I've tried, which makes Carnevino a good Las Vegas option for steak lovers.\n\nBy the way, my friends said they saw Mario Batali (he was eating with John Cusack near the bar).\n\nThe Palazzo has complimentary valet parking.  I would imagine like other major casinos that they have complimentary self-parking as well.", "business_id": "3MmHmJXr8Ltk_Z5EGE4KUw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-02", "type": "review"}

If it was here back when i was, I would have been a regular! \n\nUnlike the divey Viet diners of San Jose or Westminster, where decor is dominated by plain tables and standard issue stackable red chairs, and service is by a grumpy old Viet dude who doesn't speak English or smile, Noodles Ranch is perfect for Snotsdale, er Scottsdale.\n\nIt has a very pleasant decor of painted walls, tasteful artistic symbols of Vietnam artwork, large red, hanging upside down paper umbrellas,  4 cooling ceiling fans, a decorated cashier counter in front of the kitchen, and better quality table and chairs than their Little Saigon counterparts. \n\nScottsdale prefers looks  over substance, so it likes nice decor in favor of good food, as exampled by the many large, formula restaurants with million dollar decors but mediocre food. And remember, PF Chang's, that popular faux Chinese chain, the epitome of Decor upstaging Taste, was started right here in the Valley  of the Sun. \n\nSo seeing the tasteful decor, and seeing all the non-Vietnamese in the restaurant, kept my expectations very low on the food taste-o-meter. \n\nBut I was pleasantly surprised! \n\nNow I lost count, but this is close to the 100th different Vietnamese restaurant i have eaten in all over the country in the past 4 years! \n(see my Wanugee! lists for Pho and Vietnamese for details.)\nSo I have tasted good and bad and everything in between. And granted, I was starving from not eating all day, and here it is 7:00pm. \n\nBut when I ordered Cha Gio (egg rolls), the 6 little crispy rolls came out beautifully plated on a large, quality made and decorative platter, and unlike most orders for this in those dives, which usually come out on a plain little white saucer plate by themselves, here, they were accompanied by several large leaves of romaine lettuce, pickled and julienned slices of cucumber and carrots, sprouts, basil leaves, cilantro and of course Nuoc Mam (fish sauce) to dip them. \n\nNow most of the customers in here at the time would have dipped the rolls into the sauce, and probably poured the leftover sauce over the veggies, mixed them, and eaten them like a salad. If this were PF Changs, that is what they probably would suggest. \n\nBut I took the leafy lettuce, put an egg roll on top of it, and sampled the veggie ingredients on top of that, rolled up the lettuce, and dipped all of that fresh tasty goodness into the Nuoc Mam. This is much like how you might eat many other Vietnamese dishes in a Vietnamese restaurant, be it Nem Nuong, Banh Xeo, or even parts of Bo Bay Mon. \n\nSo I was impressed and happy with the refreshing mix of fresh veggies, crispy rolls and tasty fish sauce exploding into my mouth! Loved it!\n\nSo I figured that was for show, however, to impress the Low Fan (outsiders) with a $5.95 fancy appetizer, with Scottsdale pizzazz. \n\nMais, au contraire mon frere! \n\nThe Pho Tai Nam ($7.50) I ordered was very good! I always try the broth first, and this broth had a very rich, complex flavor! Perhaps a little sweet for the Low Fan, but very beefy, savory, and not too mucked up with masking ingredients to distract from the true flavor. The meat pieces were whole and higher quality than most I have had, with good tenderness. I had to ask for the separate condiment dish, where I mix the half Hoisin and half Sriracha, to dip my meat into, so as not to destroy the flavor of the broth. \n\nI was smiling after this meal! I even called up my Viet friend in San Jose, who could tell I was smiling over the phone, which they usually only notice after I have had good, authentic Japanese sushi or tasty and cheap KBBQ!\n\nI would recommend this place highly! It is a little more expensive than those $5.50 bowl dives on the coast, but the decor and quality of food, and the service from the owner, all combine to make a quality experience. \n\nThey offer all the usual Viet diner foods, like Goi Du Du, Goi Cuon, Mi, Com, Bun, Bun Bo Hue, etc. They also offer two of my faves I will have to try another time, Banh Xeo (crispy pancake) and Canh Chua (sweet-sour lemongrass soup).  \n\nSo this is perfect for Scottsdale, with the nice decor, but with the added bonus of tasty, quality food! They even play smooth jazz, something you would find in another Scottsdale staple - the SPA!", "business_id": "_HTE4pOKeJC7kcxiCF9vTA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-09-20", "type": "review"}

It is located along that narrow stretch of walkway that connects two parts of the casino (the one area with Mesa Grill and the casino area more towards the hotel lobby).\n\nThe decor at Old Homestead is definitely dark, but it is actually not as dark (or as old-school) as what you will find in many of the pricey steakhouses in Las Vegas.  The restaurant feels smaller, more open and even a little more contemporary.\n\nWe had a special 3-course fixed menu, which included a choice of salad, an entree with sides and an assortment of some of the restaurant's desserts.  The two salad choices were a caesar salad and their kitchen sink salad.  The kitchen sink salad (my choice) consisted of shrimp, salami, bacon, avocado, tomato, hearts of palm, blue cheese, and a vinaigrette.  The salad was decent.  The balance of the ingredients was not that great and some of the salad was a little underdressed, but the overall flavor was satisfying enough.\n\nTheir entree dishes included a chicken, fish and sirloin dish.  I opted for the sirloin au poivre, which was topped with a peppercorn sauce.  There was a garnish of Yukon gold mashed potatoes.  Sirloin is definitely not the most expensive cut of beef, but the preparation here was good.  The sirloin had a nice sear and there was a decent marbling of fat, which gave the meat a fair amount of juiciness (which can be tough with a sirloin).  The meat was tender too and flavorful.\n\nThe peppercorn sauce was quite aggressive.  It made the dish a little too peppery.  The side of Yukon gold mashed potatoes was fine.\n\nThere was also a decent breadbasket with many different choices including a pretzel roll.\n\nDesserts are typically not that special at steakhouses.  They tend to be old-fashioned and heavy desserts and that was the case here.  There was a key lime pie topped with an Italian meringue and it was actually refreshing, tart, creamy, and decent.\n\nI did not try the New York Style Cheesecake, but I did try their Big Fat Chocolate Cake, which was a chocolate layer cake with ganache.  It was not that great--dense and not that great of a flavor (kind of something you could get anywhere).\n\nService was good.  The staff was friendly and the food came out at a good pace.\n\nPrices were high like other high-end Las Vegas steakhouses.\n\nOld Homestead is a decent place for a big and juicy steak on The Strip.  I prefer Carnevino to Old Homestead, but I would take Old Homestead over chain places like Smith & Wollensky, The Palm and Ruth's Chris (which is located just off The Strip).  It is not a great steak restaurant, but it is an okay one.\n\nLike other Las Vegas casinos on The Strip, Caesars Palace offers both free self and valet parking.", "business_id": "2oRj5Qh18pCMPlvHFmyoow", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-01-30", "type": "review"}

In fact, the service was pretty god damn awful to say the least. But then again, this is a Chinese restaurant and everyone knows service is going to be bad. If it were good, I'd be shocked.\n\nSo after several attempts at trying to find good dim sum, we ventured to this place after I saw it advertised on the Chinese channel while watching TV in the hotel. Believe it or not the hotel had Chinese satellite TV feeding from Hong Kong. I was up late watching old Cantonese soap operas -- but I digress.\n\nSo anyway, one of the places advertised was this one. Hubby thought for sure the food was going to be good seeing it obviously catered to a Chinese clientele. Well he was right. The dim sum, although not artistically created into teeny weenie morsels, were done well. Not only that but everything tasted good. The tripe was steamed with ginger and scallions -- lots of flavor, not like the one at Chang's. In fact, the har gow was also very very good (unlike that of Chang's). Cha siu bao was above average (and I don't even like cha siu bao) and so was the stuffed bean curd sheets.\n\nI was a bit annoyed at the fact that when I asked for iced water, they kept passing the buck to someone else. Finally I just yelled out at a dim sum lady who then yelled out to 'amigo' in the back who rushed out towards me. Before he could even walk 5 steps I yelled out \"DOS AGUAS\" and he immediately turned around and got us 2 iced waters pronto.\n\n4 stars for decent dim sum.\n\n1 star for service.", "business_id": "8-HkVgPClpSli0ug3Uk-sQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-08-23", "type": "review"}

Having already made two breakfast stops prior and with plans for Andreoli's Christmas Festival at 2:00pm I knew I'd need to save room and as such I perused the options carefully before settling on a trio...plus one en route back to the car.\n\nStarting with the most unique, a food truck concept I certainly never saw in the Midwest and would have never expected in the desert, my first stop of the afternoon was at The Maine Lobster Lady (http://www.mainelobsterlady.com/,) a truck described as \"A Maine island girl, along with her very own lobster fishin' partner, serving the real deal Maine Lobster from the coast of Maine to the desert southwest!\" and the menu, service, and accent all hold true to that definition in every way.\n\nPriced substantially higher than the average food truck given the quality of the ingredients my selections from The Maine Lobster Lady would be two - the first her signature Maine Lobster Roll with hot buttered lobster chunks served simply on a grilled roll.  Simple, fresh, and loaded with lobster this was about as simple as it gets and although small considering the $17 price tag it would be hard to quibble this quality of crustacean nearly 3,000 miles from its point of origin as it was every bit as good as that in Boston or elsewhere (where, incidentally, Neptune charges a whopping $22 for their roll.)\n\nMoving next to a more innovative, though less impressive choice, a $9 cone of Maine Shrimp Puffs arrived as a half dozen hush-puppy sized balls of medium sized Maine shrimp tinged with butter and herbs deep fried to golden and served alongside a zippy garlic aioli.  Tender but a bit too oily for my own personal tastes and with the shrimp far less snappy than the aforementioned lobster the aioli was a welcomed boost - a shot of flavor compensating for an otherwise disappointing dish; next time I think I'd go with the Whole Belly Clams or the lobster mac n' cheese.\n\nGood, particularly given the fact that it arrived from a truck in the middle of Phoenix, but pricey at $26 for perhaps a dozen bites of food I see The Maine Lobster Lady as a well conceptualized idea to fill a void, but not someplace I'd seek out unless I really had a craving.", "business_id": "jKLR4wAywvVcGtQnCLzoRw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-12-10", "type": "review"}

Hence, although I did enjoy my meal very much, I can only give it 4 out of 5 stars. Mind you, I am judging it against the highest standards as I also dined at Bouley in New York, The Kitchen in Sacramento and Michael Mina and the Ritz Carlton in San Francisco on my recent vacation.\n\nL'Atelier is next door to the Mansion, Joel Robuchon's 'main' restaurant where the prices cause even more watering of the eyes. The concept of the restaurant chain (there are Ateliers all around the world) is to dine at the bar to 'promote a more interactive experience'. There are tables available but you are definitely encouraged to dine at the bar. One advantage of this is to watch the chefs at work in the open kitchen. The odd thing is that I found the waiters not to be very keen to chat, hence nullifying the interactive experience. I was later able to engage the maitre d' in some conversation but mainly about soccer as I live in England. A lot of the time, the staff were gathered, chatting to themselves.\n\nThe decor was dark with lots of wood. Once seated, I was offered either still or sparkling water, no ice water as an option. $8 per bottle as I later discovered. I was driving and didn't drink. My request for freshly squeezed orange juice was met with a polite 'we don't do that'. This was the only top class restaurant I dined at this trip which didn't manage to rustle me up some juice. You have oranges, you have a juicer, you have arms, how hard can it be?\n\nI opted for the $135 tasting menu. Was a bit disappointed to see that the foie gras on the internet menu had been replaced by egg though that did actually turn out to be one of the better dishes.\n\nI suppose the main disappointment overall for me was the lack of innovation or have I been spoilt by dining at the Fat Duck in Bray (in the UK)? The other top class restaurants I dined at on this trip all produced moments during my meals that made me gasp in surprise. L'Atelier produced very well cooked food which was tasty but no 'wow' moments.\n\nThe best dishes were la caille (quail), some perfectly cooked tender pieces of meat in a lovely sweet-ish sauce (sorry I can't give you more details about it but the server didn't volunteer more clues as to its ingredients when I mentioned that I really liked the sauce) served with the famous truffle potatoes and the aforementioned eggs en cocotte. Though I had enough to eat, the portions were literally a taste in some cases - maximum of 3 mouthfuls! No amuse bouches to welcome you. Some of the dishes like the langoustine carpaccio could have done with another flavour like citrus to offset the sesame.\n\nSo, although I enjoyed the meal, l'Atelier didn't compare well for me with other places I dined in the same price bracket. Also they need to inject more interaction and life into the place if their concept is based around interaction.", "business_id": "4uGHPY-OpJN08CabtTAvNg", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-09-23", "type": "review"}

Equally fond of these events (perhaps less so) than I am of chains given the inherent biases involved I will say that I waxed and waned as to whether I should attend but after e-mailing and being assured that I could write as I like, I figured why not?\n\nLocated directly across from the Biltmore Del Frisco's Grille is a swanky space befitting the upscale location and with high ceilings, an airy design giving way to a lovely patio, and an open kitchen juxtaposing a well stocked bar and walls of wine the space has all the curves and contours of a modern top end steakhouse without feeling heavy or bourgeois in the least. Light and sexy with blonde wood, black lacquer, and beige tile throughout an added bonus on this particular afternoon was the four televisions each visible from the outdoor patio, each showing a different college football game.\n\nCroque Madame: A must order when present on the menu for myself but an item previously unknown to my friend this take on the French classic featured a rather young Gruyere along with American white cheddar cheese, thin slices of jambon, and light sauce Mornay atop toasty whole grain bread. Presented alongside a light salad with a touch of vinaigrette and topped off with an over-easy egg this would prove to be the weakest of the day's six selections largely due to the mildness of the ham, crustiness of the bread, and relative lack of runniness from the yolk.\n\nSouthern Fried Chicken and Waffles: I was admittedly a bit weary of this dish since many upscale restaurants seem to be tackling this southern comfort food trend lately but after some debate between this and the benedict I think we made the right choice. Featuring a trio of mini cornmeal waffles each topped with a crisp and juicy breast of chicken plus a strip of crispy hickory smoked bacon what really set this dish apart was the crystal hot sauce spiked maple syrup. Soft and doughy meets crisp and juicy meets sweet and spicy - perhaps it wasn't as 'down home' as Lo-Lo's or as refined as Bouchon but either way it was really good.\n\nBanana and Mascarpone Stuffed French Toast: If a picture says a thousand words then I simply suggest you look at the image above-from the caramelized bananas to caramelized crust on the custard soaked brioche this was amongst the best French toast preparations I've had in recent memory. Creamy meets crunchy and loaded with flavor even before the addition of Grand Marnier spiked maple syrup this was the dish of the afternoon without question and paired with the same thick-cut hickory-smoked bacon as the waffles the only thing that could have made this better was a tableside flaming a la bananas foster.\n\nRed Velvet Belgian Waffle: In the end these turned out to be quite good and far less predictable than I'd expected. With all things appearing in Red Velvet ever since the cupcake craze began my biggest fear was that there would be nothing \"Belgian\" about these waffles, but what arrived was actually quite impressive as the quartered waffle was slightly yeasty and plenty raised with a crisp exterior giving way to a steamy and soft interior with hints of cocoa as opposed to being over the top chocolate. Again graced with bacon and drizzled rather than slathered with whipped vanilla bean cream cheese the flavors were all nicely balanced and restrained-a very well executed dish and a great choice for those not wanting an egg dish but also not wanting something quite as sweet as the French toast.\n\nNutella Bread Pudding: With coffee, a great blend with good cocoa notes and a bit of caramel roasted specially for Del Frisco's, served I explained to our server that although I realized the complimentary dishes were limited to the brunch menu I would gladly pay the $10 for dessert as I simply couldn't justify leaving without trying the bread pudding...but in the end, no check arrived. What did arrive next, however, can only be described as everything Mike likes in one gooey pile with a crisp exterior giving way to a nearly molten center rife with buttery cubes of brioche sealed together with Nutella. While I'd be foolish to call the dish 'subtle' in any way since it is certainly not for those without a serious propensity for the hazelnut spread, the team at Del Frisco's actually did a rather impressive job in attempting to add some levity to the dish with a surprisingly light ball of nearly espresso intense house-made coffee ice cream drizzled with caramel.

Wish it was served with two pieces of each type rather than just one though, just a hint of each flavor wasn't enough.\n\nAnd then there was the UNI TOMATO CREAM PASTA, the dish sonnets are written for. I'm not  fan of uni at sushi restaurants but somehow this dish works really, really well- it almost comes off as a rosa sauce with clams, but roughly six billion times better. The uni is sneaky and it's flavor is in every bite but there isn't a large quantity of it in the dish itself.

Clearly working out kinks on the fly but never once frazzled as each of several dozen options were rolled, fried, and glazed it was nearly one hour and one hundred patrons into the morning that I watched Whitford and her team work before I made my eight selections and paying the $18 tab my sampling began, a piping hot apple fritter tinged with crispy bacon proving closer to monkey-bread in its large pull-apart structure and supple crumb.  Moving next to a duo of classics, suffice it to say that whatever led to the morning delay and rushed prep-work yielded far too oily an old fashioned along with a flaccid yeast-raised ring but moving on to the filled options the chef's skills shined as house-made creams, compotes, purees, and curds all impressed inside yeasty pockets with an array of delicate glazes.  A strong believer that failing to prepare is preparing to fail but also attuned to the difficulties intrinsic to opening a new business I look forward to seeing how O Face grows and evolves but based on first impressions and a brief conversation with Chef Whitford and staff as they worked I'm rather confident O Face will soon find its footing and fill a long empty gap in DTLV.", "business_id": "7uRhJhS8hYQfau307RDjCA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-04-27", "type": "review"}

We found this joint...they offer massages for $20 per hour, with a $10 tip it's $30 per hour all-in, score!\n\nThe inside of the place is huge.  It must've been an old furniture store or something like that...plenty of little semi-private areas.  It's not like the places in Chinatown in LA where there are tons of chairs in a big room and no privacy.  We opted to get ours done together so we had an area with 2 chairs.\n\nThe masseuse perfectly massaged our feet for about 20 minutes and the rest of the time was a regular massage.  That was unexpected, but appreciated.\n\nOverall, it was an awesome experience.  I wish we had a place like this in the Phoenix area.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%", "business_id": "dfOFgjhuEp5GdHJhVzjOAA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-05-27", "type": "review"}

Not wanting a pint but rather to sample I made my way up the stairs to the small store to find it largely empty - a surprise since every parlor in Ohio is lined up out the door when it is 100 degrees out, but perhaps not surprising in Scottsdale where temperatures frequently reach such peaks.  Entering the store I was greeted by the smell of sugar, vanilla, and that all-too-familiar scent of ice cream cones and within moments I was greeted by a young lady ready with sampling spoons.\n\nNot wanting to be greedy but certainly wanting to sample a couple before buying in my first two tastes of Sweet Republic's Ice Cream would be Tres Leches, a dense and flavorful but largely one-dimensional vanilla and next Desert Honey, a lovely bite not dissimilar to a frozen liquid Bit-o-Honey.  With easily twenty more flavors to taste and my server not seeming to mind my next two bites would prove memorable enough to commit to a double - one scoop of Honey Blue Cheese and the other of Salted Butter Caramel - for $4.25.  Waiting for the scoops as I browsed the shops collection of cookies, candies, and even bacon brittle I thanked my server for her assistance and sitting down to enjoy my choices I was very pleased by one and blown away by the other.\n\nBeginning first with the Salted Butter Caramel, a flavor I try everywhere, this dense concoction with pockets of liquid gold oozing from the otherwise milky sweet ice cream was exceptional and on par in all ways with that of Jeni's back home - potentially even better though a side-by-side would need to be done to be certain.  Moving next to the Blue Cheese - easily a top 5 ice cream moment of all time with the sharp notes of the cheese aptly countered by the sweetness of the honey and the overall texture somewhere between frozen frosting and cheesecake; an absolute must try for anyone living in or visiting the area whether it is 100 degrees or not.", "business_id": "Bc4DoKgrKCtCuN-0O5He3A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-14", "type": "review"}

There are two sections of this review that add up to the 3 Star Rating.  Here it goes....\n\nConvention Facility - 4 Stars\nThe Las Vegas Convention Center is a very good facility compared to other cities.  I've been to the Dallas & San Diego convention centers recently and they aren't as nice as Las Vegas.  The facility is in great shape, the South Hall is relatively new and parking isn't too bad between the area parking lots and the Las Vegas Hilton next door.\n\nFood - 2 Stars\nThis is where it gets ugly.  The food offerings here are split into two distinct groups......the Franchise & the Non-Franchise options...\n\nThe Franchise options receive anywhere from a 3 to 4 Star rating.  They have Starbucks, Nathan's Hot Dogs, Sbarro, and a Capriotti's To Go.  On my recent visit this past week, I ate at all 3 of them and can tell you that Nathan's Dogs were the best of the 3.  Sbarro is a close second.  Starbucks is Starbucks....nothing special there.....and the Capriotti's To Go is a good option for quick eating on the Tradeshow Floor, but is nowhere near as a good as the regular restaurant.\n\nThe Non-Franchise food options get a deserving 1 Star from me.  The food is just awful.....and I mean nasty.  I tried two Cheeseburgers from the grill in the main food court area between the Main Hall and the North Hall.....they were easily the most disgusting Cheeseburgers I've ever had in my life.  Seriously, they were worse than the boiled garbage we were served in High School....and damn, those Burgers were crap.  The convention center Burgers were Bland, the top of the Bun was rock hard and tasted stale, and the bottom of the bun was wet & soggy from being prepped in the back kitchen for so long with the special sauce & tomatoes sitting on top of it so by the time the Burger was served the Bun & Toppings were just an awful mess....disgusting!\n\nI will never again eat at the Non-Franchise food outlets at the convention center....proceed with caution my friends.\n\nOk, so if you add all of those ratings up....it levels out to 3 Stars overall in my book.\n\nWill I return?  I attend so many trade shows, it's kind of hard to avoid....but I enjoy the convention center, so I will definitely return.", "business_id": "Rnx0d7HExjZcd8q7PXmrPA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-08-11", "type": "review"}

Without a doubt my favorite breakfast pastry and perhaps my favorite French pastry overall, Essence's $3 twice baked option arrives slightly smaller than the average but with a shell that crackles to the tooth and an interior that is at once yawning pockets of air and nearly overloaded with butter and light frangipane there is no doubt that this is a case of \"big things in small packages,\" and particularly in its still-warm morning state the flavors and textures rivaled those at Dominique Ansel and Payard Las Vegas for best I've had stateside.\n\nMoving next from the baked goods to one prepared from the menu my second taste of the morning aside from the slightly earthy and lightly leather accented coffee was Essence's \"Signature\" French Toast, a $7.25 selection featuring three griddled slices of eggy brioche and a sidecar of what I can best describe as banana infused caramel.  Rich but thinly sliced and therefore nicely saturated each piece of the French Toast was exactly as it should be - the exterior crisp and the interior custard-while the sauce provided a pleasant balance of fruity notes and intrinsic sweetness that complimented rather than overwhelming the bread.\n\nAt this point submitting to the fact that I was going to eat even the items I'd bought 'for later,' my next two tastes were a pair of $2.95 macarons that, much like the croissant, rivaled those both here and abroad in terms of taste and texture while opting for a much more rustic approach terms of size and presentation.  Beginning first with Pumpkin Spice and then proceeding to Vanilla with Dark Rum each palm-sized cookie was exactly what one would expect from a well trained pastry chef as the exterior shell provided a slight crackle on bite subsequently giving way to a soft meringue followed by dense cream that slowly dissipated on the tongue - the cinnamon and nutmeg notes of the former particularly notable while the rum in the second was appropriately understated thus serving to highlight the vanilla of the shell.\n\nIf there were any 'misstep' on the morning, it *might* have been the \"Summer Berry Croissant Bread Pudding,\" though when I say misstep I must temper the comment with the fact that my quibble is only that I prefer the French/English take on the dish while this one was more based on the French Custard style, a rich vanilla bean pudding without a lot of crunch or textural variance but instead laden with blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries plus a sidecar of lightly sugared strawberries.  Focusing more of the natural sweetness of the fruits and aromatics of the vanilla than the typical overly sweet versions served stateside it was more panna cotta than bread pudding to me, but chalking that up to personal tastes it was still delicious.\n\nMoving last to the one dish that gave me trepidation, the \"French Napoleon\" gave caused pause not only because the name clearly skewed towards a subset unfamiliar with a proper Mille-Feuille but also because so many pre-made versions of this layered pastry have failed to wow in the past...thankfully this was not the case at Essence.  Featuring light and crunchy layers of choux easily withstanding the tines of a fork without turning into a smooshy mess (see \"Mille Feuille New York\") intertwined with rich pastry cream speckled with dots of vanilla bean and ripe raspberries what truly made this version stand out was the manner in which Theodosopoulos caramelized each layer of choux, a technique reminiscent of Pierre Herme and as good as the French icon's version was I'd be hard pressed to say Essence's was any less impressive.  It would be awesome to see what they could do a la minut like Savoy, L'Arpege, or Genin and given the names I've dropped in the paragraphs above plus Essence's proximity I've no doubt I'll be returning to see what else the small shop is capable of soon.", "business_id": "eTbtfgUtfewdncgVf2CbWw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-16", "type": "review"}

Actually, they have 5 different Yakitoris and Tempura selections. \n\nBut if you feel like mixing your Japanese with Chinese, try the Poisson Szechuannais ou L'agneau Mongolien. Thinking about noodles? They have Pad Thai au Poulet ou Boeuf, ou Udon.  They even have on Vendredis et Samedis la Cuisine Chaude, \"Boulettes de Pieuvre\" ou Takoyaki! And being in Quebec, they offer Escargots Gratines. Oh, and if you want a little flavor of Korea, order the Kimchi! No Poutine, though!\n\nThe service was actually pretty friendly and efficient, and the food wasn't bad for an AYCE place. Dinner is $25.50, and you fill out your 2 tickets, and when you are ready, fill 2 more out till you're full. \n\nIf you feel like Asian food but want a variety and you are really hungry, this place is meant for you.

The free Pirate's Show at Treasure Island came to mind as I have seen it at least a dozen times. Honestly, I won't waste my time to see it again.\n\nEmbarrassingly bad and cringe inducing. What they heck did they do to the Pirates show that we all used to love? It is just awful and non-watchable now.\n\nHey, I am the first to admit I like free, cheesy, campy, kitschy stuff. That's why it pains me to hate on this show. Sure, the girl pirates look hot, but the guy pirates seem like effeminate douches now, the piped in music is lame that they lip sync to, and the crowds are always annoying. Even last year when I walked by as the show was going on I just did not even bother to look. It also gets too crowded, and you need to get there early to secure a good spot to view one of the multiple shows each night. Halfway through you wonder why you wasted your time when it could have been better spent seeing something else on the strip.\n\nIt's just not worth it anymore. The older show with the pirates battling the British Empire ship was so much more fun. This is like watching the staff of a local Hooters try to act out Shakespeare - and failing miserably.\n\nAt least the pyrotechnics are cool, and it's still fun to watch one of the ships sink, but whoever redesigned and rewrote this show should be walked off the plank.", "business_id": "gnafBL9EZE1kn0xD7Yf3_w", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-01-27", "type": "review"}

We were very disappointed with the entire Mandarin Oriental experience.  We've heard so much about their 5 Star service that we had our hopes up.\n\nWe walked from Aria to Mandarin Oriental.  You have to walk down a long set of stairs to get to the entrance.  On the way down, we noticed how filthy the stairs were.  I realize it is windy, but 5 Star properties shouldn't have trash on stairs like that.  There was a lot of trash too.\n\nOur next disappointment was that there was no doorman to open the door for you.  I don't want to sound like a snob, but I thought that was a requirement for a 5 Star property.  Well, there were none.\n\nThen the two employees in the lobby didn't greet us.  They ignored us while we looked around for the elevators.  We had to approach one of them to ask how to get to the lounge.  He was busy texting someone on his cell phone....hmm....5 Star service?\n\nWhen we arrived at the lounge, we were very impressed by the decor.  Again, it shocked us because there were 2 employees behind this huge desk and not one of them greeted us.  We were well dressed and looked proper, so I don't know what the deal was.  Anyway, we were finally seated in the lounge and our waitress spilled the water when she filled my wife's glass, but didn't clean up the spill on the table.....what?  and she poured across the table instead of next to us....wow, that's 3 Star service 101 and they can't get it right here?\n\nThe wine selection was very good and the Cabernet I ordered was fantastic.  The views from the lounge are spectacular.  That's the only reason why this place got 2 Stars....I was very tempted to give it 1, but the ambience, decor, and quality of the wine gave it the extra Star.\n\nNormally this kind of stuff doesn't bother me, but we wanted a 5 Star experience....we could have spent much less money somewhere else and received better service.

I was a pimply-faced teen who just got my driver's license and borrowed my dad's aquamarine '68 Pontiac Catalina to drive to the Berkeley Community Center with a gaggle of like-minded pubescents. I remember not only her repertoire of mostly retro-songs but also her hilarious impersonation of Shelley Winters in \"The Poseidon Adventure\" (it requires placing your belly on a barstool). \n\nShe's 64 now and looking pretty great all things considered. Her show this past Sunday, cheekily dubbed \"The Showgirl Must Go On\", is not only a tribute to her storied career but also a fresh take on her legendary status amid the recycling of familiar characters from days of yore such as Delores DeLago, the wheelchair-riding mermaid lounge mainstay, and aged chorine Soph, Bette's tribute to burlesque comedienne Sophie Tucker. The show starts with a CGI-generated twister on a big screen that segues into Bette singing her big-band number, \"Big Noise from Winnetka\". The energy never flags, least of all Bette, who goes through the mandatory costume changes in record time.\n\nUnlike Cher's more contemporary, Cirque-inspired show, Bette's is pure vintage Vegas with twenty beautiful showgirls, the Caesar Salad girls, to go along with her back-up trio, the Staggering Harlettes (her term, not mine). The ever-changing sets are elaborate and sumptuous, but nothing overshadows the diminutive Midler. Her voice is the best I've heard it in a long time despite a lost crescendo note on \"When a Man Loves a Woman\". All the hits are here from the kitschy \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy of Company B\" (backed by a video of her as the Andrews Sisters circa 1973) to \"The Rose\" (performed as a duet with surprise guest Pink) to her vocal high point, a haunting rendition of John Prine's \"Hello in There\". \n\nBut Bette is also a first-class comic providing risque zingers about Celine Dion, Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh and Tiger Woods to make even this fan blush between hysterical fits of laughter (\"I guess his wife didn't know what he meant when he said he was playing 18 holes.\"). The woman just knows how to deliver a punchline. She even sets up her last song with sincere gravity and starts to sing the opening bars of Celine's \"My Heart Goes On\" before taking things more seriously with \"Wind Beneath My Wings\". Jamie W. and I had great seats in the rear orchestra section which cost us $145 a piece the day before. Well worth it given that Bette proved to be both a diva and a trouper throughout the ninety-minute set. My one regret in sharing this review now is that she finishes her two-year run at the Colosseum at the end of the month, but I'm sure Bette is not one to avoid another encore.", "business_id": "Z-h5nCo1-rHvli4npCkxmA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-01-19", "type": "review"}

Clearly leaning on Simon's penchant for comfort food whimsy and benefitted by the skills of Executive Chef Matt Andrews it was specifically at our request that items rolled out of the kitchen with deliberate individual pacing and beginning first with creamy deviled eggs crowned in briny bubbles of roe the hits came quickly, a back-to-back pairing of chicken skins and bacon marmalade each justifying their early 'signature' status while a follow-up of nutty rabbit cooked tender in bright tomatoes over shredded squash showed equally well.  Generally underwhelmed by the meaty lamb 'tacos' wrapped in lightly charred pita and finding the empanada overwhelmed by the onion-heavy sauce it was back on good footing that the kitchen found itself with a deep bowl of crispy sprouts balanced by pork plus balsamic and culminating in a flatbread teaming with mushrooms beneath an especially heady blue it was onward to dessert that we progressed, a trio of options served simultaneously with both the subtly sweet bread pudding and decadent brownie arriving boozed up and bound to impress.", "business_id": "sih8j621A66QoiUFues5qQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-08-17", "type": "review"}

Transitioning smoothly to things more substantial it would be an exercise in futility to determine whether the rich, caramelized-yet-rare spring lamb over smoky artichoke puree or the nutty roulade of rabbit with flan of carrots was a superior secondi and finishing with dessert both the simple peach presentation and an atypical souffl\u00e9-style budino showed the pastry kitchen's prowess - a Babboesque box of petit fours and a double espresso sending us to theater with full bellies and broad smiles.\n\nObviously prone to complaints of discrepancy in price-to-portion ratio for \"Italian food\" that many claim to be offered at a better value from their local mom n' pop joint a meal at B&B Ristorante is better taken as a \"Fine dining\" event rather than any regional cuisine - not only does the sourcing, preparation, and presentation deserve it but so does the service.

I had previously known him as the author of a few catchy songs, and a huge proponent of gorging yourself on peanut butter and bacon (both things I can respect).

His charisma is readily apparent, and demands your attention.\n\nThat said, what kept me at the edge of my shockingly comfortable COUCH (not seat), was the acrobatics. I am not much of a \"dance show\" kind of guy, but there is no denying that the performance these hugely talented people put on is visually stunning. I was absolutely amazed by the inhuman ability of the acrobats to move as though the laws of gravity simply didn't apply to them.\n\nNow, diehard Elvis fans might be a bit peeved that the creators may have taken some liberties with the story, but I'm in favor of anything that allows the acrobats to showcase their skills. For instance, a single quote in which Elvis mentioned comic books was extrapolated into an unrelated superhero sequence in which several acrobats bounced around on trampolines. I couldn't care less that it probably didn't relate to Elvis (it was damn entertaining), but I can see how some might. \n\nPerhaps this all indicates that I might have been even more impressed with some of the other, less Elvis-focused performances...but all I know is that I had an unexpectedly awesome time, and I would gladly see any Cirque show in the future.\n__________\n\n*In a scene that was ultimately cut from the theater version of the film.", "business_id": "_WZd1YRYAX1d2hCxmyjI9w", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-11", "type": "review"}

It was 10:45 am and I wondered if they would be open.....they were, lucky me!\n\nI was greeted by the owner and his Wife.....at least it appeared as if they owned the joint.  They were very friendly and welcoming.  It's a casual restaurant with 10 or 12 tables inside and 8-10 counter seats near the grill.  There's also a few tables outside with umbrellas if you like to dine outdoors.\n\nI browsed the menu and was getting excited with every item I saw.....Vienna Beef Dogs, Beef Sandwiches, Iltaco Pizza Puffs......WAIT, Pizza Puffs?!  Holy $hit, that changes everything....I love those things!\n\nI couldn't control myself, so I ordered a #2 Two Chicago Dogs w/Relish, Pickle Spear, Tomato, Hot Peppers, Mustard, Onions, Seasoned Salt....and Fries ($6.00)....plus I ordered a Pizza Puff ($3.50) and washed it down with a bottle of Coke Zero.  Dammit, there goes the diet!  The lady asked for my name and asked if I was dining in or taking out....I told her dine-in.\n\nI saddled up to a table and anxiously waited for the food.

They were eating Chicago Dogs and he was telling his Son how a Chicago Dog is made and how it should taste....the owner, who was grilling it up was there telling the kid about how to make the Dog....it was awesome.\n\nAfter a few minutes my order was ready.  The lady brought it out to my table....I unwrapped both Dogs and the bag of Fries and put them together on one wrap so I could eat it uninterrupted.  She told me the Pizza Puff was still cooking so it would be a few minutes....that's pretty standard to wait for Pizza Puffs, so I didn't care.  The Dogs were covered in Mustard, which is how I like it.....if you don't like too much Mustard on your Dog, I suggest you tell them ahead of time.  The first bite was an explosion of Awesome on my taste buds....it was sooo good!  The Vienna Beef Dog was full of flavor and the combination of toppings was just how I remember the Dogs in Chi-town.  The Relish is the atomic green colored stuff you find in Chi-town.  This place is legit!\n\nThe Fries were piping hot and seasoned with a Salty seasoning....if you don't like your Fries too Salty, then I suggest you either ask for them plain or tell them easy on the seasoning.  I liked it.  It complimented the Dogs just right.  The Dogs were average size.....not too big, do don't expect a 1/4 lb Dog with the #2.  I think they offer larger Dogs with other combo meals, but not with the #2.\n\nThe Pizza Puff came out shortly after I started eating.  I waited until I was done with the Dogs before I moved over to that bad boy.  It was wrapped in the traditional Iltaco Pizza Puff wrapper.....those of you familiar with Pizza Puffs know what I'm talking about.  I bit into the greasy, flaky, doughy Crust and mmmm.....yeah, it's the Pizza Puff that I've grown to love.  Inside of the flaky, doughy Crust is a filling of Pizza Sauce, Sausage, and Cheese.  Dammit, these things are addicting and I just discovered this place....I have a feeling I will be here often.\n\nThe owners were very attentive and asked if I was ok and needed anything.  After I was finished, they asked how I liked it....I gave them the thumbs up and a big smile.  They were smiling too and said \"See you soon Peter!\"......I love family owned businesses who pay attention to their customers.  While I was there 6 or 7 people came in and they knew all of them by first name.  I hope I get to know them better too.\n\nWill I return?

Generally fancying a vanilla base to chocolate, particularly when pairing with accoutrements, it was with the mash-up of pink-frosting and Iced Animal Crackers between a warm Snickerdoodle and seasonal Oatmeal butterscotch that my tasting began and with pronounced sweetness found at each turn one couldn't help but feel like a child at heart, the scoop of subtly salted Pecan Praline ice cream a far more nuanced 'adult' flavor that proved a perfect counterpoint to a dense chocolate brownie while pairing marvelously to the buttery notes of a textbook chocolate chip cookie, the edges just crisp while the interior remained chewy and soft.\n\nPerhaps not as 'artisan,' yet far less spendy than the ice cream sandwiches at Monte Carlo's BLVD Creamery or Sprinkles at The Linq, Sweet Addiction is the sort of place both 'foodies' and families can enjoy without breaking the bank, each cookie ringing in at under $1 with discounts on larger orders available as items are baked fresh to replenish supplies throughout the day.", "business_id": "7CeaeSsxiYj3P3ZurTetzQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-10-13", "type": "review"}

But what isn't in this town? \n\nIf you are looking for a cheap sushi fix- you probably would be better off going to a sushi joint off the Strip and in one of the nearby neighborhoods.

Check out Sushi Samba. The throbbing pulse of the music, the dim lighting, and the modern seating all add up to one \"happening \" place. \n\nLocated in the Palazzo hotel, Sushi Samba is a \"sushi fusion\" restaurant so know before you go that you can find Brazilian and Peruvian food as well on the menu. I was looking for a casual, low key night out and by sitting at the bar I got it as I was able to watch the parade of \"pretty people\" go in and out of this place in their \"club wear\" as I sipped my drink and ate my sushi. \n\nThe sushi was good although nothing really stood out for me. They also had 3 kinds of raw oysters on the menu which, at $4 each add up quickly so be sure to do the math before you order a couple of dozen! \n\nService was good. The bartender kept an eye on me and my food came up quickly and efficiently. \n\nThe price for 2 drinks ($13 each) 2 rolls, 4 oysters and a piece of sashimi? $75. Like I said . . . pricey but good. \n\nSo if it's a evening out that you want, with a little sushi on the side- Sushi Samba is your place.

Since I already knew about it, I walked up like I knew what I was doing....until they started speaking to me in Spanish.....then I got a little flustered.\n\nThe menu is very simple....there are only a few things you can order and it's printed in large letters above the kitchen counter (see pics).  I decided I wanted to try the Chorizo Taco & Carne Asada Taco....and then curiosity got the best of me and I went for an order of Carne Asada Fries....they are $10 while the Tacos are $2....what does $8 more get you?  I was about to find out.  I threw $2 in a tip jar on the counter in front of the cooks and waited patiently for my order.\n\nThe food is homemade and made from scratch right in front of you....including the Tortillas.  You have to grab a tray and wait for your cook to make your order because they hand it to you right after they make it.  From there, you pay at a register on the other side of the room by the door....kind of like a Cafeteria in a Hospital or Convention Center.\n\nMy cook made me the two Tacos first and told me that he'd call my name for the Carne Asada Fries.  He asked me if I wanted everything on the Tacos...I said yes even though I had no clue what that meant....after I got the Tacos, I realized that it meant Onions, Cilantro, Guacamole, and Salsa....perfect!\n\nI jumped right into the Chorizo Taco first....it was pretty good.  Good proportions on the toppings and the size of the Taco was decent, worth $2.  Next was the Carne Asada Taco....but before I could take a bite, the cook called my name for the Fries....when I picked it up I knew I was in trouble....the damn order of Fries was huge!  It must have weighed at least 3 to 4 lbs!  Seriously!  (see pics)\n\nI finished off the Carne Asada Taco...which was pretty good.  The meat was fresh and cooked perfectly....it wasn't overcooked and didn't have too much fat on it.\n\nThen I looked at the beast called Carne Asada Fries....no wonder this damn thing is $10....it can feed 4 people!  I knew there was no way I could finish it and felt bad because I was going to waste a lot of it.  I grabbed my fork and attacked it.....basically, it's French Fries (think McDonald's sized cuts) covered in Cheese, Guacamole, Carne Asada, Sour Cream, & some other kind of Cream.  The Fries were cooked just right....not too soft, not overcooked.  The flavor of the dish was awesome.\n\nI gave it my best shot, but could barely finish just under 1/2 of the plate (see pics)....great value though....could easily feed 4 normal sized human beings.\n\nThe only gripe I had about the joint was a lack of a Salsa Bar....or Hot Sauce.....I would have loved to pour some on my food, but had to do without...that's what kept me from giving them 5 Stars.\n\nWill I return?

With the exterior crackling and the interior of each appropriately buttery with good separation between the layers I think it is simply a case of personal preference that the texture was a little too wet for me, even if the maple cream version was quite subtle and pleasant.

It remains an iconic front to Sin City, an all encompassing resort with the cheese of a gimmick theme without the sleaze of downtown. \n\nUntil the hideous Imperial Palace (http://www.yelp.com/biz/imperial-palace-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas) came into the Harrah's / Caesars family, it was the lower end of the property totem pole and often the butt of many jokes in today's contemporary resort renaissance. The corny decor, the antiquated amenities, and the lack of anything substantial in the resort sense has made it a lower end property. And that's precisely why I like it.\n\nGiven its location, the Flamingo is very budget friendly in every sense of the word. The occupancy rate is likely to be high, considering its awesome low prices during the week and doable rates on the weekend. The regular rooms are comfortable and semi-spacious, not nearly as junky as early perception would lead on otherwise. There is good value in their higher end suites and in an attempt to modernize their hotel game, the GO rooms and FAB rooms will definitely surprise people with how contemporary and sophisticated they are.\n\nBarring no plans for renovation, the casino is predictably small. There are a good number of table games with a heavy emphasis on black jack (Spanish 21 is also available), various poker games, and craps + roulette. Slots, whose inventory makes up the bulk of most casinos is lacking in inventory compared to their property counterparts, but rest assured most games will be available, though perhaps *unavailable* when there are too many grannies plopping down to build on their player comps if you catch my drift. WIth regards to comps, TotalReward points are easier to apply here but accumulation will be the same anywhere.\n\nAll forms of dining are going to be close to lackluster or borderline horrendous.

When Taco Bell owns you, that's when you know there is a problem.\n\nThe best thing at the Flamingo for me, is the pool. Some might call it one of the better pools on the strip and locals tend to come here more often than not. There is no elaborate nightlife centered around the pool, just good people watching, sufficient space to swim or float in, and quality pool side service for all things outdoor.\n\nAnd of course, for a (cheesy) photo op or children's activity, visit the Flamingos when weather appropriate.

Came down from our room for a late dinner using a coupon but had difficulty finding it, as the sushi bar is located within the Bennihana \"village\" that includes the Zen Lounge, a noodle bar, and the actual Bennihana.  Once we asked we were able to find it without a problem, though.\n\nInteresting setup continues once you are inside- sushi bar has seating along the bar to watch the chef or at a few small tables. We opted for the tables and were seated near the center, where a water display is in full view. It was a little too loud for our liking though, and despite sitting close had some difficulty hearing my date. At times felt we were speaking too loudly when we adjusted our volume to be able to hear one another. Cute interior, lots of things to look at- even caught sight of an Asian couple leaving the upstairs portion following a wedding dinner. The elevator was pretty cool also.  \n\nCoupon was for savings with purchase of a combination- date got one with a decent selection and I got the rainbow roll, and we picked at one another's food. I also got a salad (not so great) and the miso soup (which included lots of tofu, for some people that's a plus).  Fish was fresh and roll was tasty, which may have converted my date- he added a spider roll to our order, which was also fresh and delicious. \nDate had an entire bottle of sake to himself, which he ordered before realizing I was not going to partake- he enjoyed it but it's not quite my thing. I did, however, have a margarita on the rocks, which seemed like an odd selection but went well with the light fish meal. \n\nWaitress and the other server girl walking around were both very sweet and made limited but polite conversation with us. Loved the authentic kimono uniforms.

Eventually I used chopsticks and my hands.

And I don't mean some sort of silly metaphor in that I'm going to walk away with the memories of the time spent. That's too easy and to This American Life-ish.\n\nNo, there's no Ira Glass in this review. I'm talking about simply taking something. Yes, it may be a bit of a klepto move, but in this case I took a menu. A full menu from here. I just put it in an New Times (Holy fuck, they still print this places?!) and when I left, it came with me. So if you noticed a missing menu, Lost Leaf, you know where it is now. Tough shit, you're not getting it back!\n\nNow you would think this is just strange behavior. That I have some sort of problem. It's not typically anything of real value. Some flier for the place, a business card perhaps or maybe even a beer coaster. These are things that would normally get thrown out by the staff if I left it behind on the table when I left anyway. So it's not that harmful, right? \n\nIn this instance it's because this place has such a vast and impressive beer selection ranging from all over this brownish sandy red land (it is the desert after all) that I just had to take something to prove that their beer menu actually existed. That I wasn't just making it up because I spent a full 7 hours on the road and then another 7 more driving back in the course of one day. Take it as a compliment and send me a bill for the paper you printed it on, if you are so inclined. \n\nThe setting is very dimly lite. Let me back track here for a second. This place was really hard to find. I mean, really hard to find. I'm not sure why Arizona has found it necessary to have one ascending order of numbers on the East side of town and when you count down to 0 in terms of streets it becomes Central and then starts the numbering system again. So you can pass 7th street and then a couple blocks later pass 7th again. \n\nI was driving down 5th st. endlessly looking for this very normal looking house that is a bar. Little did I know it was ten blocks over on 5th place or whatever the hell they were calling the street. Arizona, shape up here. When you come up to this joint you're going to be confused. It looks like a normal house. \n\nIn fact I was curious to see if we had to use a door bell. But once inside in this dimly lit amazing lounge you pull up a chair and look at this huge list of beer that you can choose from. Beer from Arizona, from California, form New Mexico. Bottles of microbrews that I was really just in heaven from looking at this list alone.\n\nThen when they pulled the cold beers in the fridge I finally realized it wasn't just a dream. Who would have thought? A-freaking'-mazin! The lounge had some DJ space or room for a small band to just play there. It was something else entirely. A mix of your friend's cool place with a well stocked fridge. \n\nThey had a beach cruiser bike sitting in the place for sale, which might I add, where the fuck is a beach near here? Yeah. Exactly. That's what I thought! But still, it just goes to show you that this place has its roots in this community and is all about just making it the local chill place. Get a beer or two, sit in the lounge. Steal a menu.. These are all things that I came to love about it. \n\nOh yeah, and the local artist's art hanging on the wall for sale is also a way to give back to the community of local artist.. I guess. I'm sure they owe more in a bar tab than the painting can make.. I'm sure of it. Hmm, maybe I should jump back on my art to make extra beer money.\n\nWhat an awesome place to relax with a cold one. The beer alone makes this a destination spot if you're ever in Arizona. And if they haven't banned me for stealing a menu, I will definitely go back again! \n\nI guess the lesson to be learned from all this is that in a city that monitors your speed on the highway with cameras, is known for having a tent city prison that makes inmates wear pink leads to people finding an urge to lash out at authority. Why else would it be legal to carry a firearm in this state. You really can't be surprised that someone like myself would steal a copy of your menu. \n\nGiven the chance.. I would do it again and I want to return to the scene of the crime again and again.", "business_id": "pQ3kRVmttsV1bHxuTf7TAg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-02-26", "type": "review"}

I have a bittersweet feeling about those shows as the Mirage is both a good and bad spot for them.  Here's why:\n\nPROS\n- The meeting rooms are in great condition.\n\n- The ventilation is just right.  The temperature is appropriate for the large crowds....whether it's AC in the Summer or Heating in the Winter, they get it right.\n\n- The banquet and meeting staff is always professional, both in terms of appearance and manners.\n\n-  The layout of the meeting rooms allows for good foot traffic flow between rooms.\n\nCONS\n- Parking here is a mess.  The Self Parking Garage can get full very quickly and the parking spaces are tight.  Valet is a nightmare....you can count on at least a 45 minute wait for large conventions if you Valet.\n\n- Distance from parking to meeting rooms.....it is a very long walk from the Parking Garage to the meeting rooms.  Valet is not much closer.  It can make for a very long day, especially when you're walking around the Trade Show floor all day.\n\n- Restaurant options are far from the meeting rooms.  Yes, there is a coffee shop nearby that sells sandwiches, but that line can get really long during large shows......your only option is to venture out into the casino floor and the restaurants are scattered throughout the property.  There aren't any good quick eats option there.\n\nOverall, it's a good experience....not great.\n\nWill I return?

The dining room definitely feels hipster and young, but its design is so much better than other restaurants with a young vibe.  Typically, these type of restaurants (like Animal and Pizzeria Mozza) feel too dark, too loud, too cluttered, and maybe even too ordinary.  St. Francis though presents a very lively and young atmosphere that is really open, warm and with smart design touches.\n\nWe came in late at night, but there was a fair amount of light in the room, which really opened up the room as well as allowed some of their food presentations to shine.  The restaurant featured some great metal tables that reinforced the casual theme.  The booths were comfortable.  The ceilings were highlighted by sharp looking wood rafters (that were outfitted with expertly placed small lights).\n\nThe walls of the restaurant were a nice exposed red brick that really went well with the wood fire oven.  The restaurant also featured big, large windows that actually looked like mirrors.\n\nThe menu (a mix of locally sourced rustic dishes with upscale flair) went very well with the decor.  Unfortunately, the food was not as good as the decor though it did show potential and maybe it would have been better if we had ordered differently.\n\nWe started with the french fries, which were thick and nicely browned.  They looked like carnival fries or Five Guys fries (the kind of fries that go nicely with salt and vinegar).  They are the perfect fries when cooked right because they will be crisp on the outside and hot and soft on the inside.  Unfortunately, the fries here were not that crisp.  A little bit soggy.\n\nWe had a few of their salads.  One was a Caesar Salad with kale instead of romaine.  The kale was quite bitter.  The salad was heavily dressed (maybe to contrast the bitter greens).  The croutons were fresh and good.  The other salad was a mix of romaine with fresh and crisp apples and smoked bacon.  It had a much better flavor and balance than the Caesar Salad.\n\nWe tried a few of the flatbreads.  The flatbreads here were pretty thick and doughy and unlike the crispy and light flatbreads I am more used to having.  We had the chicken flatbread, which was roasted chicken, arugula and caramelized onion.  The caramelized onion made this pizza too sweet.  The pizza was sweet like BBQ chicken pizza so if you like that type of pizza, you may like this one.\n\nThe other flatbread was more of a traditional pizza; it was topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella and a savory and spicy sausage.  The pizza had a satisfying flavor, but it would not stand out against other good pizzas I've had.\n\nI also had the seafood cioppino, which was shrimp, clams, mussels, white fish, sourdough, and herbs in a spicy tomato broth (finished in their wood fire oven).  I was not a huge fan of the tomato broth.  It had some heat to it, but the flavor was not that distinct.\n\nThe seafood was unevenly cooked.  Some of the white fish was moist and soft while other bits were dry.  Same for the shrimp.  One shrimp was succulent and nicely cooked while another shrimp was overcooked and quite chewy.  The mussels and clams were not that great (they definitely suffered in comparison to what I've had in California).\n\nWe finished with the sticky toffee pudding, which was a sweet date-filled cake on a toffee sauce.  The cake was nicely sweet and somewhat moist though it lacked the consistent, throughout-the-cake moistness of the sticky toffee puddings I've had at Wilshire and Grace.  The sticky toffee pudding was served with sweet cream gelato, which was creamy and refreshing.\n\nWe also had the banana fosters that seemed to be more like banana cobbler than banana fosters.  The dish consisted of banana slices in a caramel sauce.  The bananas were simply warmed up; they were not caramelized or bruleed.  The bananas were topped with a nut crumble and dark rum molasses gelato.  The dark rum gelato was very good.  It tasted like rum and was creamy and sweet.\n\nService was pretty causal but pleasant as well as quick and attentive.\n\nPrices were what you would expect given the restaurant's reputation and the dishes offered.  A lot of the entrees were in the $18-$23 range.\n\nSt. Francis has a great dining room and the food definitely shows potential.  The food on our visit was not great, but if you order right, you could be in for a good meal.  The restaurant has a very local feel, which makes it a good one to try if you are from out-of-town and are looking for something more specific/unique to this area.\n\nThere is an attached parking lot with complimentary valet.", "business_id": "uKSX1n1RoAzGq4bV8GPHVg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-17", "type": "review"}

I made a little money playing poker, so I only left $170 in Sin City.  That's for food, gas, hotel, everything.\n\nOne of the reasons I was able to do this was that I got two meals out of Earl of Sandwich for a grand total of $6.48.  My car got to Vegas hours before our friends, so we decided to have a cheap, casual dinner.  I did a quick search on Yelp, and this place came up with its hundreds of reviews.\n\nEarl of Sandwich is in Planet Hollywood, a kind of funny theme hotel if you know anything about Los Angeles.  I find it amusing that the mall is billed as the Miracle Mile Shops, as if the Miracle Mile is a glamorous shopping mecca in L.A.  Even Earl of Sandwich is out of place - it's a chain restaurant, but there isn't a single branch in California.\n\nDon't be alarmed that it's a chain.  It's a step up from Quizno's (though I like Quizno's, and Subway, too), and I appreciated its impressive efficiency.  There was a short line to order, but once we got our orders in, we sat down with our buzzers.  They started buzzing while we were getting water, and our food was hot and ready within five minutes of arrival.\n\nI ordered the Full Montagu with roast beef, turkey, aged swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mustard sauce.  I had half for dinner and half for lunch the next day - I never went hungry, and the sandwich reheated great.  It was really tasty, with good ingredients and plenty of them.  I also tried some of my friends' orders - the Italian sandwich and the Earl's Cobb.  The Italian was maybe even better than the Montagu, with a meatfest of salami, capicola, ham, and mortadello, topped with mozzarella, roma tomato, and a zesty Italian dressing.  Peppers were optional and delicious.  Even the salad was pretty good.  It wasn't a deprivation salad - it came with plenty of grilled chicken and bacon, swiss and cheddar cheese, and a buttermilk ranch dressing.  But it also had plenty of greens and tomato, cucumber, and cranberries.\n\nIf you're in Vegas for the full Vegas experience, go balls out, hit Robuchon, whatever you want.

Dining at Chelsea's Kitchen feels like dining at an actual standalone restaurant and not an airport sit-down eatery serving mediocre food at outrageously high prices.  Chelsea's Kitchen at Phoenix International Airport has an attractive contemporary look--lots of dark lacquered wood.\n\nThe menu features a variety of options including several courses that can be made very quickly if you are in a hurry.  You will find several restaurant style starters, a few burgers, upscale taco plates, and hearty entrees like seared fish, prime rib and ribeye steaks.\n\nI started with the tuna tartare and guacamole.  It came with a tower of tuna tartare at the base with radish and soy-lemon vinaigrette and a topping of creamy guacamole.  The tuna tartare and guacamole tower was served with a large portion of tortilla chips.  Overall, the starter had a good flavor.  The tuna was fresh and moist while the guacamole was very creamy.  There was nothing particularly special about it though and the tuna tartare could have used more heat.  The chips were okay and had a good crunch; they were a tad salty.\n\nI also had their braised beef short rib tacos, which came with a very generous portion of beef short rib and then several accompaniments to make a taco including corn tortillas, lettuce, guacamole, and pico de gallo.  The substantial entree also came with a side salad of kale, which featured interesting garnishes including roasted garlic and strong cheese.\n\nLike the tuna tartare, the ingredients with this entree were very high quality and the overall flavor was good but nothing special.  I wish the braised beef short rib had more heat and seasoning, but there was no doubt the beef was very nicely braised; the fat was rendered down and the meat was very tender and juicy (very unlike a lot of airport eateries where you get dry proteins).  All of the garnishes were very fresh.\n\nFor dessert, Chelsea's Kitchen offers a signature key lime pie as well as several gelato flavors from a local gelato shop (Grateful Spoon).  I had the pistachio gelato and it was good and creamy though it tasted more like ice cream than gelato.\n\nService was good--quick and friendly.\n\nPrices at Chelsea's Kitchen are high like other airport restaurants, but the quality of ingredients was significantly better than most airport restaurants I have been to and the portions were very generous.\n\nChelsea's Kitchen is a nice airport restaurant.  I wish it was located past security though so it could be enjoyed by more people (travelers on layovers as well as people departing Phoenix who want to get through security and settle down before dining).  If you arrive at Phoenix International Airport and have time to kill though, Chelsea's Kitchen is a good option and more satisfying than most airport restaurants.\n\nI am not sure what the parking situation is at Phoenix International Airport, but I imagine parking here is expensive like other airports.", "business_id": "OE7RmfGvpvSEv4g3xDKfSw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-06-23", "type": "review"}

While I do find it odd that I found myself being led into Burger Bar by my friend when I don't particularly like beef and don't eat burgers, I will admit to have had a few in the past and my all-time was the Thurman Burger in Columbus Ohio, a famous one in its own right.  In a day that included Tableau for breakfast and Alex for dinner I must say I didn't expect much from the Burger Bar....but I was pleasantly surprised.\n \nWhile the Bar was located in a shopping mall at Mandalay Bay I didn't judge....most of Vegas feels like a mall anyhow and Per Se in NYC is located in a mall, as well.  Arriving around 2:30pm there was a line...a good sign I guess....our names were taken and 10 minutes later we found ourselves seated at a 4-top in the middle of the restaurant.  While the place was quite loud, conversation was quite easy and our menus were delivered quickly.  With 5-6 bread options, 5-6 meat options, 40-50 topping options, plus desserts it actually took longer to order than we had imagined.  Eventually I settled on the Turkey Burger on Ciabatta with grilled Shrimp, Pesto, and a side order of Sweet Potato fries while my buddy opted for the Kobe Beef Burger with Sharp Cheddar and Hickory Bacon on Whole Wheat with Spicy Skinny Fries and a sampler of beers.\n \nAs the place was busy we chatted for a bit and I decided to get up and explore.  Much to my surprise the kitchen was wide open for viewing and I wandered about to realize how fresh all the ingredients were, the bread being baked in visible ovens, and the meats stored in large lockers.  Everything appeared very hygienic and clean, very much unlike your average burger shack.  By the time I arrived back at the table my buddy was working on his beer and approximately two minutes later the food arrived.  While I spent a moment dressing my burger and eating my incredibly garlicky pickle spear, I heard my buddy partially-moan....clearly he was loving this burger.\n \nOnce my burger was adequately dressed and I had a large pile of ketchup for my fries it was time to dig in.  Crisp ciabatta with a fluffy interior first greeted my tongue followed by the wonderful basil blast of the pesto mingling with plump and tender shrimp and well cooked yet juicy turkey.  Great texture, quality ingredients, wonderful flavor, well cooked....what more can you ask for in a burger?  I next dug into the fries which were simply fantastic and #3 only to Michael Mina's Duck Fat Fries and Michael Symon's Lola Fries in terms of crispy outside and soft/salty inside.  I do find it rather unfortunate that the restaurant did not order an organic/original ketchup given the quality of the ingredients otherwise, but I guess a minimal amount of HFCS won't kill me.\n \nHaving finished off our burgers and laughing more at the PTI analysis of the USC/Oregon State result my buddy and I opted for a dessert burger - the chocolate version featuring a split donut topped with a chocolate gnache puck, mango \"cheese\", and strawberries.  Humorous in presentation and tasty in flavor, this choice was excellent and split down the middle this \"burger\" was just enough after the huge burger/fries.  The mango cheese was especially surprising in its fresh taste and jello-like texture while the chocolate puck was so rich I doubt I'd have finished one myself.  The donut was a tad dry, IMO, but didn't hurt the burger overall.\n \nAll told I liked the energy and the food at Burger Bar.  While certainly our most \"low class\" meal, I actually enjoyed the experience and the pricetag more than Sensi and Craftsteak and my buddy loved it which was excellent since he humored me in going to so many French restaurants on the weekend.  IMO, foie and truffles are best served by a chef like Stratta or Savoy and not on a piece of beef and buried under toppings...the concept of the Rossini Burger is ludicrous and anyone ordering it is showing off and missing out on the opportunity for more originality and customization at a lower price.  Regardless, to each his/her own and I think the concept of designer burgers has a lot to offer...even if the underdressed and uncustomizable option at Father's Office is still the standard by which most burgers are judged.", "business_id": "xyTJYlbE_MLouK6rCou6zg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-10-02", "type": "review"}

Located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan somewhat hidden in the back, the restaurant is certainly eye catching.  With an entryway shaped like Buddha and \"Mexican Takeout\" windows on either side the campy feel is palpable, but acceptable.  With an interior of communal and separate dining tables, a noodle making station, and wall decorations ranging from Chinese Opera Masks and Lanterns to Luchador Masks and Oaxacan carvings the interior was colorful to say the least.  In addition to the fixed objects there were also large morphing murals - projections of famous and peasant Chinese and Mexican individuals.  To see the restaurant is to love it-or perhaps to hate it-it is certainly over the top.\n\nArriving in warm soft shells and approximately three bites each the first tastes of taco would come from Langosta.  Described as meaty lobster/mango/arbol chile sauce ($16 for 2 now, $6/e prev) the flavors were good, but unfortunately the lobster was slightly overcooked and I felt the chile sauce overwhelmed the subtleties of the sweet crustacean.\n\nSilencio tacos - duck tongue/rambutan fruit ($4.5/e.)  Unfamiliar with rambutan until this time I was impressed by the fleshy sweet fruit and its ability to temper the salty, savory, and somewhat chewy tongues.  While not as nuanced as some of the other tacos, these are definitely worth checking out if only to experience the ingredients at a relatively cheap price.\n\nThe Cochinita tacos, described as Yucatan-style pit barbeque pork/marinated onions ($4/e) were good, but rather expected and unidimensional.   Savory and sweet the pork and onions melded nicely, but in total the flavor was no better or worse than a good pork taco anywhere else.\n\nCarnitas braised baby pig/pork rinds/spicy salsa verde cruda ($4/e prev.)  With the braised baby pig perfectly done-supple, moist and flavorful-the addition of pork rinds added a lovely degree of crunch and saltiness.  Tempering the other two dishes and adding a bit of spice plus vegetal acidity the salsa was spicy without being overly so-in my opinion they should serve this salsa instead of the chipotle version with the tortilla chips.\n\nCoctel de Camarones fresh shrimp/jumbo lump crab meat/tomato/avocado ($12.)  Essentially a whole lot of underwhelming salsa in a bowl with a couple of snappy sweet shrimp, thin shreds of crab, and chunks of avocado plus tortillas for dunking it was almost as if someone forgot to add salt, or spice, or vinegar, or really anything other than the listed ingredients which simply were not of all that impressive quality.\n\nLove Is In the Air heirloom tomatoes/sugar air ($8.88) was much simpler in ingredients and much more complex in flavor.  Nicely presented in a large bowl with what must have been two fresh whole tomatoes and a splash of vinegar the dish was topped with an \"mg\" manufactured foam full of delicate sweetness that acted only to enhance the natural flavors of the tomatoes beneath.\n\nLamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You vegetables/crispy lace ($11.88 now, $8.88 at our visit) delivered five pockets of lamb, cabbage, radish, and smoky seasonings inside a crispy lace shell.  While slightly oily, the lamb itself was impressively cooked and not a bit gamey-with the m\u00e9lange of vegetables elevated by the cumin and black pepper this dish was clever and tasty with obvious contributions from both Hispanic and Chinese cultures.\n\nOcean Nest scallops/crab/shrimp/pan-fried egg noodles/seasonal vegetables ($10 at our visit and now $22 w/ king crab/lobster) would be a successful yet rather ordinary dish.  With crispy noodles resting in a gentle fish broth at the base and three head-on shrimp, three scallops, and a few chunks of crab interspersed with bok choy, spinach, and onions the flavors all worked and the textures were nicely done-at $10 the dish was a steal, but lobster or not I don't think I'd recommend it at the current price point unless there was a good deal more seafood.\n\nThe Unruly Monk with hand-cut noodles/bok choy/wild wood ear mushrooms/poached egg ($16) was served in an enormous bowl with perhaps a half liter of broth, boiled bok choy, a single egg, and a plethora of mushrooms the dish would be a nearly mirror experience of the Ocean Nest-a nicely executed dish, but no better than could be made at a local Chinese restaurant in most mid-sized US cities.\n\nIn the end I think the verdict is still out on China Poblano - I'm not willing to rule it out, but I'm also not ready to say the \"concept\" (which is exactly what it is) \"works.\"  While certain dishes worked to great effect, others merely represented decent versions of Americanized ethnic food, and some were simply underwhelming.  Looking at the menu only 2 weeks after my visit I already see many changes and given Andres' propensity for exploration I've no doubt the menu will continue to evolve as they find what works and doesn't.", "business_id": "cMvN1j-LK64zqmT4vnl8NA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-05", "type": "review"}

Don't burn the locals\n2. Don't wager money you aren't willing to lose\n3. $1.99 Steak may sound like a bargain.. it is not \n4. When you get 11 at blackjack, YOU ALWAYS DOUBLE DOWN\n\nWell, with those out of the way you should add another one to the list\n\n5. When in Vegas, ALWAYS GO TO THE DOUBLE DOWN! \n\nUpon arriving to this off the strip bar you'll be greeted with a sign that says \"Happiest place on Earth\" As much as you'd like to believe that this is irony, it's not. It's all truth. \n\nYou may second guess me when you walk into this dark bar that is completely punk rock. I mean, it's COMPLETELY PUNK ROCK. I don't care if you come in here after a sock hop, you will be leaving PUNK-ROCK AS FUCK! \n\nThe bar is unapologetically awesome and in your face from the looks of all the graffiti that lines the walls, to the name of the drinks and to the attitude of the bartender. But let me tell you, you will never have as much fun in Vegas as you will have when you're in here. \n\nHunter S. Thompson would have loved this place, that beautiful bastard. \n\nThis is what America would be like if the 80's punk scene didn't fizzle out and become such a mainstream sell out like the hippie movement prior to that. This is the Anarchist dream. Right-o.  Not to mention they have Bacon Vodka... yes, they serve you up a Bacon Martini. \n\nAs someone who HAS made his own home made bacon infused vodka, I can say that there venture into the land of bacon infused drinks came out slightly less than mine, but you know what, Screw the bacon vodka - Bring on the Ass Juice! \n\nAss Juice - Yes, that's right.. the ass juice is a signature drink which if you can take the name as something that is simply trying to scare you, you will enjoy what is really in this drink. It's really tasty. If anything, it's a drink you have to drink with one pinky up. It's like a fru-fru drink in a small shot glass. \n\nThey have deals for the working man. A can of Schlitz, some ass juice and some beef jerky. What more can you ask for after a long day of work? How about some Leprechaun piss?That's right. They seemed to have added a new insulting and gross named drink to the menu. \n\nLeprechaun piss - A green concoction that is more like melon schnapps with a mixture of other things. Careful, these are really chick drinks in that you really don't know how much alcohol is in them as it's really well masked. They are tasty and sweet and they will kick your ass. \n\nThe bathroom looks like a CSI crime scene. Crude pornographic images and graffiti smeared with mustard that had dried to a hard yellow crust? These were not the hoofprints of your average drunk punker. No, what sort of crimes have happened in this restrooms? Who cares? And for that matter, it's sort of pointless to wash your hands as you were going to touch the door on the way out.  \n\nThe Pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance for me that sold it that you ALWAYS HAVE TO GO TO DOUBLE DOWN when in Vegas is that they have a Photobooth. Well, I have to say I haven't done a photobooth in a while and this one was perfect. The old saying about what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas is full of shit. \n\nIf you can't make and enjoy those memories... even if it's because you're highly intoxicated from small midget piss or product of a juicy ass, then what's the point? \n\nThis place is a complete punk dive bar experience and as threatening and crude as it is, It's really warm and inviting. \n\nhell-to-the-yes.

Add in that this place is about a mile from home for me, and that it's 24 hours, and it's pretty much kismet that I would finally come here and actually really like it.\n\nFirst off, its a bit  pricier than expected: spent $25 on dinner for me and the BF.\nAs others have said though, the sandwiches are beyond huge enough to share.  We got the #32 peppers and onions cheesesteak with provolone ($11), added on sides of chili cheese fries ($4) and an order of wings (10 for $8), and a Franks black cherry soda ($2).  For the price, the sandwich and wings were good portions. I didn't think the same thing about the soda or fries though- but then again, I'm not a soda person in the first place, though I understand this brand is apparently something special.\n\nThe sandwich itself, in addition to being huge, was stuffed full of meat and veggies. The cheese was a little light for my liking, and it was slightly on the dry side toward the ends of the sandwich, but it was good. In the future, I'd probably stick to the mushroom one though.\nThe chili cheese fries were fairly standard and a smaller portion than I expected but we still devoured them in record time. The wings, though, were a surprise. I ordered the mild ones rather than hot, and still found these to be surprisingly spicy. I'd definitely hesitate before ordering their \"flamin'\" style, I can't imagine how much hotter they must get. Portion was good for the price, wings were an average size without being too small or overly fried or breaded. Huge portion of ranch for dipping. I liked how easily the meat came off the bone, too. A little less messy than usual. \n\nWe ate at the patio area, and it was noisy and difficult to carry on conversation, as others have said. However, it wasn't a total turn off and in fact kind of added to the experience.

It's probably no mistake this theater is located in  Summerlin, all while adding to the already superstar property in the Red Rock (http://www.yelp.com/biz/red-rock-casino-resort-and-spa-las-vegas-2#hrid:xHArSOVpxZ5XdGP4sMVLUg)\n\nMovie ticket prices aren't as spendy as some crosstown location spots, most of which don't have the cushy seats, stadium seating, and pixel perfect digital projections like this one. Service has always been on point, which for concession stands and crowd control, is a near miracle in some parts.\n\nI think what makes this Regal theater stand out is the fact it's in a casino. In addition to Red Rock Lanes (http://www.yelp.com/biz/red-rock-lanes-las-vegas), this place serves as another family friendly option in a resort that just seems to have a little bit of everything. For all of you high rollers out there, I highly recommend the VIP booths in the theater (inquire with your casino host / vip services), it's a real plus when catching a flick in LV's best theater.", "business_id": "Xid3zRo37or7flf6h48lfA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-12-21", "type": "review"}

BF and I opted for a plum wine and the crispy rice with spicy tuna dish from the HH menu, then shared the \"pick 3 for $15\" special, opting for the salmon skin roll, the Alaska roll, and the shrimp tempura udon.

I'd come back and get two or three orders as a meal, which for a dollar a piece isn't bad pricing. Pieces are large enough to be a couple of bites each, too.

Cook's has it in spades, so much so that the Royal Palms, the hotel that it is located in, has a \"Director or Romance\".

No problem. How about a poem reader? Got it. Or a private violinist? Again- they will make it happen. They will even put together a private dinner out in the garden for you. \"Ahh. Romance\", she says wistfully while thinking about her evening. \n\nBut I digress . . .all this talk of romance has overshadowed why I always choose T Cooks for dinner every time I head to the Scottsdale area. It's the food, the bar, the service and of course the ambiance. \n\nEnter this historic Mediterranean villa and you know you are in for a special evening. To the right, the restaurant, to the left, the bar. And not just any bar. Live music is always playing and the bartenders (Jason and Jeremy) are terrific. You can eat at the bar (they have a separate bar menu) but my advice is to wait and eat in the main restaurant. \n\nUsually I ask to sit outdoors- either in the front courtyard around the trickling fountain, or in the back, Tuscan styled gardens. On this night- it was a little cool so we compromised and took a seat by the windows looking out. \n\nWarm, fresh bread is placed on the table with a garlicky pesto sauce. Try not to eat too much as you'll want room for their wide variety of appetizers and entrees. \n\nWe went with the charcuterie plate, plenty of meats and cheeses to start. As for our entree's the sliced ribeye was the pick of the night. But there are plenty of choices from chops, to fish to lamb. \n\nService was spot on (friendly, accommodating, and attentive) and we even got to meet the \"Director of Romance\", Robert, who made me wish I had known about this service before. Robert asked if we were staying in the hotel (we weren't) for if we were- he said he could work his magic on our room while we ate. It made me want to change hotels, if only for the night! \n\nOur evening ended back where it began at the bar listening to old Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra tunes being crooned out by an amazing duo, while sipping a tawny port and reflecting on the dinner we had just experienced. \n\nThis is not a cheap date.  Dinner for two was around $200 but worth every penny.  Go ahead, splurge.  It's worth it.\n\nAhh. Romance. If you were wondering where it went in your life- check out T.

The Ramen was very good, full of flavor.  I had the Veggie Miso Ramen and it was awesome.  The Better Half had the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen and she thoroughly enjoyed it as well.\n\nOther notes:  They make the Ramen fresh to order, so it's a bit of a wait.

After the marvellous meal I had at Kai, it was hard to imagine anywhere else in Phoenix being as good but thanks to Phoenix Yelpers, I was pointed in the direction of this little gem\n\nBinkley's is definitely a destination restaurant as it's located in the little town of Cave Creek 40 minutes drive north of Phoenix. However, it is aiming at the high end of the market and culinary experience. It reminds me of The Fat Duck in England, which is a 3 Michelin star restaurant located in a sleepy rural village\n\nI think the phrase to sum up the dining experience at Binkley's is joie de cuire. You can sense the pure joy & excitement of discovering new tastes, textures, temperatures & combinations of food in the dishes that come out of the kitchen & as other diners have noted, these little explosions of flavour are most prominent in the numerous amuse bouches that arrive regularly through the meal. It's as if they're using the regular courses you order to draw you into the restaurant so they can share these little culinary discoveries. This molecular gastronomy style of playing & experimenting with food is also very reminiscent of The Fat Duck - if you enjoy the food at either place, you should try to eat at the other restaurant. If you prefer meat & 2 veg (British phrase!), this may not be the place for you\n\nI love the great flexibility in customising your choice of menu with the different combinations of tasting menu available. 5/6 dishes on the menu change daily depending on the ingredients available\n\nOn arrival, I was offered a seat at the counter or table & I chose a table to better view the drama of the restaurant. It wasn't til later that I noticed a large hatch through which chef Kevin Binkley was able to keep an eye on the dining room & it was good to be able to have a chat to him at the end of my meal. Service was efficient & I was impressed that the chief server took over service at my table when I showed a geeky interest in the food & culinary techniques used in its preparation\n\nHere was my culinary extravanganza. The flavour & presentation of the food was top notch & there was a hint of drama and a few surprises with most of the dishes. I hope my descriptions can convey the playful inventiveness of the kitchen\n\n1. Arugula vichycoisse with white truffle oil. Mmm... everyone should try white truffle oil, which is a real concentration of earthy umami flavour\n\n2. Serrano ham cream with breadstick. Great ham flavour & I wanted more!\n\n3. Frozen melon dots - watermelon, canteloupe & honeydew with prosciutto powder. You could clearly taste the different flavour of each melon\n\n4. Sweet potato, ginger & prosciutto, all served on a steel skewer with lovely maple froth. Unexpected combination of ingredients and it worked!\n\n5. Cucumber, salmon mousse, quail egg a& cornichon with crisps on the side. Another lovely unusual combinatio\n\n6. 3 types of potato fried at 3 different temperatures, served with salsa verde, bean dip & aoili. Lovely and light\n\n7. Pina colada shot, served on a flashing lamplight. Lovely combination of flavours\n\n8. Duelling foie gras. The first was 'dipping dots' where torchon like foie gras was dropped into liquid nitrogen & served with passionfruit. The second was a foie gras milkshake. I have never eaten foie gras like this before!\n\n9. Pork belly with 3 preparations of watermelon - gelee, fresh & puree, with watercress sauce. I love pork belly and I love watermelon but would never have believed that they could be served together so successfully\n\n10. Pork rillette served with pickled vegetable for sweet and sour contrast to cut though the wonderfully rich pork. Accompanied by carrot foam & powder\n\n11. Mozarella cream poured over bacon & garlic confit. I had to check my terrible doctor's handwriting in my notebook twice to be sure of this combination but it's accurate! And I've written yum next to it!\n\n12. Glazed sweetbreads with macadamia & bok choy. I found the glaze a little too sweet for me & detracted from the creamy sweetbread\n\n13. Bacon & egg vol au vent with the most beautifully cooked duck egg (sous vide, I later discovered)\n\n14. Hamachi with deep fried skin (becomes like pork crackling, which I love). Accompanied by a delicate saffron cream & cippolini onions, fried grits, fava bean and lobster mushrooms\n\n15. Guava sobet palate cleanser\n\n16. Roasted tenderloin of veal & divine unctuous braised cheek done in molasses and chilli oil, eggplant puree and zuchinni. The meltingly tender cheek just fell off the fork\n\n17. Essence of lemon in 2 preparations (sorry - couldn't read notes!)\n\n18. Meringue with root beer centre & popping powder\n\n19. Choc milkshake with balsamic & a choc ball with liquid orange centre\n\n20. Huckleberry - foam in liquid nitrogen, peanut butter sandwich & fresh with vanilla cream\n\nThis is an amazing culinary extravaganza", "business_id": "yJMLD-6AggZNdC-GonVBsA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-03-28", "type": "review"}

I felt the food deserved 4 stars but the service is what brought this review down to 3 stars.  The waiter wasn't very friendly.  He was probably hung over or hated his job.  For this type of restaurant with lots of press and hype I would think Bobby Flay would know how important service needs to be.

Small in size but sizable in selection, with ice creams imported from Treat in No.Cal matched to locally baked goods from Al's, Valerio's, and more it was with pleasant conversation about flavor profiles and why specific vendors were chosen that I chatted with Ms. Gonzaga during the course of my visit and sampling several ice creams with results ranging from bold (burgundy cherry, ube) to overly icy and sweet (peach cobbler, macapuno) I eventually opted to invest in the ube alongside the only three items made in house - a duo of cookies and a chocolate brownie, each served hot from the tray.  Beginning first with the ube, apparently oft mistaken for taro by guests, I was immediately taken by the starchy potato textures admixing with cream plus subtle sweetness and pairing this with cookies and crushed peanuts the ice cream sandwich shined, my favorite bites coming at the end as the melted ice cream melded with butter and macadamia nuts with a decidedly tropical tilt.  Moving onward to an option without ice cream, I could not help but order one of the restaurant's brownies when I saw the pan procured fresh from the oven and with dark chips strewn amidst a semi-sweet base the result was decidedly decadent, the sort of thing that would have gone excellent with milk...or as the base of a sundae, the pralines and coffee a seemingly brilliant pairing though I imagine vanilla would work quite nicely as well.\n\nNot quite as impressive as Sweet Addictions if only due to overall lack of house made cookie options I can definitely see Eis Cream improving with time and customer feedback provided the small store can generate enough foot traffic and staying power given its tucked away location on the backside of a strip mall on South Eastern.  Potentially a bit overpriced given the quality of the goods, the upcharge on Al's already sub-par Kronuts particularly perplexing, it is a good option for those in the neighborhood or those seeking something different - the hand packed half-gallons potentially a tempting proposition for those picking up a cake from nearby Freed's.", "business_id": "iN0HhYwuF5BhGDDqUPKitQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-10-21", "type": "review"}

Setting prejudices aside and deciding to let the food do the talking I was pleasantly surprised.  Full review with pictures is in my blog, highlight dishes are below:\n\nWith the kitchen moving surprisingly quickly despite (or perhaps because of) the late hour it would be perhaps fifteen minutes before our first course of the evening would arrive and although something I'd not have traditionally ordered the Almejas Al Vapor would prove to be well worth its \"best in the valley\" designation.  Described as Peruvian in origin and served in a large low-bowl along with dense \"pan de yucca\" bread with a good sponge for dipping this complex amalgam of spicy aji Amarillo chile powder, tender clam stew, rock shrimp, chorizo, roast corn, basil, garlic, and turmeric was everything its ingredients suggested and then some - hot and spicy, smoky and garlicky, sweet but saline, and all the while complex without being overwhelming.  While I personally could have stood for just a bit less salt and a touch more sweet to temper the spice this was a small quibble balanced nicely by the sweet rolls.\n\nFor the second of this round of appetizers my favorite plate of the meal would be presented as \"Duck Carnitas Empanada,\" an invariably upscale take on the traditional empanada with a golden flaky shell harboring orange glazed duck confit and an admixture of habaneros, mushrooms, cilantro, and queso Oaxaca.  Delectable on its own but certainly open to further adornment the empanada was subsequently topped with a chunk of seared foie gras and finally with a foie fortified queso Oaxaca pan sauce and a drizzle of tamarind oil with the end result sweet, savory, and totally decadent.\n\nLeft with a bit more time to digest and a lot less noise as the restaurant's population had literally dwindled by half a mere forty-five minutes after we were seated the final savory of the evening would arrive just after 11pm and as I was doing the ordering it just so happened to be a second round of my favorite fowl, this time the \"Green Chile Duck Confit.\"  Ample in portion and more so in flavor this pile of two legs and two thighs featured a whole lot of duck for the dollar but unfortunately was just a bit less crispy than one would have hoped - a small quibble as it was not greasy, but not \"textbook\" confit by any means.  Again spicy without being \"hot\" the duck subsequently topped with sultana serrano peanut mole and paired on the plate with savory \"cheesy fried hominy\" that tasted something like a cross between popcorn and corn nuts plus smoked mushrooms to help ground the rest of the flavors.\n\nFor dessert The Mission's Pumpkin Bread Pudding with Scotch, Caramel, Pepitas, Pomeganate, and Chipotle seasonings was quite outstanding.  Beginning first with the pudding, almost a steamed sticky pudding in texture, the flavor of the pumpkin, cinnamon, and clove was present in spades and the scotch tones blended nicely with the sweet caramel giving it all a heavy handed boozy bite.  With a touch of spice from the chipotle cooled by quickly melting dulce de leche ice cream I additionally found a lot of appeal in the pumpkin seeds and pomegranate with their respective salty and sweet crunch adding some texture.\n\nA modest tab, particularly when split, we opted to divide the bill down the middle and with that we made our way to the streets where, as I'd been told, few people were to be found at 11:30pm even on a Saturday.  Saying our goodbyes I made my way to my car satisfied with my meal at the Mission and realizing that perhaps my bias against \"scene restaurants\" was a bit unfounded, much like my preconceptions about \"Southwest cuisine\" - a fitting conclusion to my first trip to Arizona and a bit of reassurance that I could undoubtedly live here.  Sure the city shuts down early but to be completely honest by the time we left The Mission it was already nearly 2 hours after my typical bedtime anyway.", "business_id": "YKOvlBNkF4KpUP9q7x862w", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-02", "type": "review"}

So if you are not a fan of those themed places, you may like The Cosmopolitan.\n\nI can see how some people would find The Cosmopolitan a little boring when compared to some of the other Vegas casinos.  Luckily, The Cosmopolitan does have a few noticeable advantages over Aria and provides a much more unique experience.\n\nFirst, the decor is nicer.  Very upscale, sleek and contemporary.  The atmosphere throughout the hotel and the casino floor reminded me of some of the nice and trendy places you may find on Sunset Blvd in West Hollywood.  I felt there was a sense of style and point-of-view with The Cosmopolitan while Aria felt much more sterile.\n\nThe Cosmopolitan (which was designed to bring in some residential business) also features bigger rooms with more apartment-like features such as kitchenettes.  All the rooms I went to had balconies, which were nice (haven't seen that on The Strip).  The balconies were also thoughtfully designed to prevent accidents.  Depending on which side of the building your room is located, you may get treated to a great view of Paris, Bellagio and the Bellagio Fountains.\n\nFinally, The Cosmopolitan was bringing in a lot of young people (at least right now).  That might be a plus or negative depending on your life stage.  Place was definitely crowded and hopping.\n\nSeveral of the restaurants at The Cosmopolitan have locations in L.A. (Scarpetta, Comme Ca and STK).  I think they also have some upscale shopping boutiques, but I did not check them out.\n\nThe Cosmopolitan is a nice hotel and it is one I would consider staying at if the price was right.  The balcony is a nice touch and the rooms were also nice.  It also has a great location by being near other big casinos like Bellagio, Caesars Palace and MGM Grand.  And unlike Aria, it is much closer to The Strip.  If I wanted to try one of the newer hotels out (in the CityCenter or near it), I think The Cosmopolitan would be my first choice.\n\nI saw valet parking here.  I am not sure if they also have a parking structure for self-parking.", "business_id": "AtjsjFzalWqJ7S9DUFQ4bw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-24", "type": "review"}

Personally not a fan of mustard, particularly the pungent Dijon utilized here, what ended up happening was aunt enjoying the salad along with her soup while I de-Dijoned the crispy trotter and enjoyed it with a few leafs of green.\n \nPlogue \u00e0 Champlain:  Admittedly possessing a substantial sweet tooth and a fondness for every ingredient present on the plate this composition of a buckwheat pancake topped with bacon, mashed potatoes, foie gras, Ile-aux-Grues cheddar, eggs, and thick maple syrup infused pork stock was #1 on my list of things to try order at APdC and without exaggeration I'll simply say it is one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.  A bit breakfast, a bit dessert, and entirely over-the-top savory this is probably the truest representation of what one should expect at Au Pied de Cochon and while I can't say there is anything subtle about this plate it was much like the Monte Cristo in that everything present was noteworthy; an accomplishment that I personally consider validation of Picard's skill of balance in the face of something that could seem sloppy and contrived under other circumstances.\n\nFried Chicken:  Already realizing we had ordered too much even before our main courses arrived the fact was confirmed when two 18\" platters arrived, the first my mother's daily special of 'whole' fried chicken...and when the team at Au Pied de Cochon says whole they aren't fooling around.  Juicy and plump - apparently brined in a combination of buttermilk, maple syrup, and spices for the better part of the day - what was presented on this plate was a chicken coated head-to-toe  and fried crisp alongside house peppered pickles, maple slaw, and onion rings.  Again favoring gluttony (both in presentation and in flavor) over any semblance of restraint yet keeping an eye on balance what I particularly enjoyed about this dish was surprisingly the sweet versus savory interplay of the slaw and the pickles, both serving to as ample foil to the fried food, refreshing the palate and keeping things interesting with each bite.\n\nPied de Cochon:  ...and then there was this, APdC's signature dish featuring a whole pig's leg that was partially deboned and filled with foie gras imbued stuffing prior to being breaded and fried.  Individually tagged and plated atop creamy mashed potatoes with a gravy of foie, lard, butter, onions, broccolini, and mushrooms plus a thick slice of seared duck liver on top this was pure debauchery and although it was slow going each bite brought me back for more, a journey that ended when only approximately 25% of the potatoes, a few bones, and a bit of broccolini remained - a feat that led our waitress to fetch Chef Picard who'd apparently suggested there was \"no way were going to eat all that\" when he saw our order and earned me a smiling nod of approval.\n\nThe Winter Sundae:  With nearly 200 minutes of digestion while watching the Canadians and Lightning play an entertaining (if not meaningful) game we returned to the same table and the same server for a second round and after joking that I was going to order a second plogue as dessert I instead went with the old adage that there is always room for (maple) ice cream - plus maple cotton candy, maple toffee, house made salty caramel, a brownie, cranberry preserves, maple nougat crumble, and whipped cream.  Creamy and crunchy, sweet and salty, chocolate, maple, and without a doubt \"winter\" - delicious.\n\nPecan Pie for two and Sugar Pie for two:  At this point hardly paying attention to menu descriptions it didn't seem illogical to order items made \"for two\" and unable to decide between the pecan pie or the sugar pie we opted for both...not realizing that they would arrive with a goblet of ice cream...each.  House made like everything else at APdC and each warm, decadent, and irresistible I could see both the ladies eyes glazing over into food coma status with each progressive bite and despite the late hour an Americano became requisite - free refills on the house as we sat and chatted with the wait staff and a neighboring table while enjoying the flaky pastry and creamy brown sugar custards with the occasional bite of thick vanilla bean ice cream for good measure.\n\nThe Verdict:  While I can certainly understand some of the criticisms of both the restaurant and Picard's personal style I could not have been happier with my visit to Au Pied de Cochon - it is comfort food taken to an entirely different level and it was every bit as good as I'd hoped it would be - it was good enough that I went twice in the same night and good enough that my next trip to Quebec will be predicated by a visit to Picard's Cabane au Sucre followed shortly thereafter by another visit to APdC.", "business_id": "KKucN3P6aH84MCfPr56a8g", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-12", "type": "review"}

A part of the local community since 1995, with a bakery plus deli up front and full service kitchen behind, it was just prior to the restaurant's 7am opening that I arrived and with a small line of regulars already awaiting entry it was not long before we were ushered in - many heading straight for their bagels and pastries to-go while the rest found a seat amidst friendly, if not overly attentive service that often left coffee empty and empty plates to pile.

Moving from good to better, both the enormous pecan roll as well as eggy house baked challah were beautifully presented after a quick treatment on the buttered griddle and although I'd have preferred to see the French Toast offered with pure maple syrup (even if at an additional charge) this is a small quibble for what may be the best simple or 'traditional' French Toast I've had in recent memory, particularly with a portion big enough to share.  Last but not least, a limited sampling of the baked goods yielded a quintet of toothsome rugulah - all textbook - plus a final surprise I've not seen in ages; a rich half-pound slab of traditional Vanilla and Cinnamon Bread Pudding with the day-old Challah soaked in sweet milk overlying a near-savory custard base strewn with raisins, each layer delicious on its own but combining to form something wholly satisfying both cold at the counter and all the more so when warmed up later that evening.", "business_id": "pQSkGB3HIunzNn_vIRWUNQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-01-05", "type": "review"}

With the Nopal a downgraded version of the egg topped item on the standard menu served only at happy hour and featuring tender cactus with a bit of salt and pepper plus queso fresco atop a four inch corn tortilla I started with it expecting it to be the most mild and as anticipated, it was quite bland.  Moving next to better options, the Barrio polo featured the same warm and tender tortilla topped with chicken, onions, green chilis, and hefty cream sauce plus Oaxaca cheese while the corn smut iteration proved to be by far the most complex and balanced of the trio, the woodsy mushrooms and aromatic shallots heavily perfumed by the huitlacoche.  All in all a good start, but certainly not the best I've tasted and skewed far to the left in terms of cost/quality.\n\nCurious as to how the pork at BQ stands up to others in the valley I next opted for the carnitas appetizer but was instead served a carnitas taco - cheaper at $3 compared to $9, but not what I'd asked for.  Not really wanting to make a fuss and figuring I could save the stomach capacity this was another decent taco - fatty pork with ample notes of marjoram, thyme, and garlic served with a light accompaniment of onions and cilantro...2 good bites, but nothing to write home about, especially when compared to what arrived with it.\n\nPresented along with the carnitas, the \"El Rey Vasito de Elote\" is apparently a signature dish and as much as one may find it hard to see corn as a signature, this is pretty darn good.  Described on the menu as sweet grilled corn in a cup topped with butter, mayo, aged cotija cheese, tapatio salsa, cilantro & lime at a cost of $5 what made the dish really shine was mostly the corn and the cotija - sweet, savory, and smoky at once with just a bit of acid to meld all the flavors.  Served solo and meant to share this dish is also offered over fries, but for my money it was best taken by the spoonful alongside other plates or wrapped in a warm tortilla, free on request.\n\nFor my final round of savories I went with one of the weekend specials and an order from the 'masa' section of the menu and having expected more small plates I certainly got more than I'd expected from both.  Beginning first with the later, a dish called Tlacoyos arrived with three mashed corn fritters topped with smoky chicken, black beans, salsa verde, oregano, pickled onions, cotija cheese and lightly sweetened cream.  Having expected something more akin to a traditional corn fritter form the $9 plate what I really liked about this open-face interpretation was once again the balance - a composition of flavors and textures akin to the Elote but tilted further to the savory yet finishing with light sweetness imparted by the cream.\n\nMoving to the biggest dish of the night the tripe and hominy soup entitled 'menudo' arrived in an enormous bowl and at a cost of $5 it was simply outstanding.  Featuring a rich tomato stock rife with offal, bones, tender hominy, and myriad spices plus a quartet of onions, cilantro, lime, and pimento pepper with which I was free to further season as I like this was a portion easily big enough for two but so good that those who love tripe should probably just order one of their own.\n\nStill with two and a half hours before dinner at this point my server again stopped by and after perusing the dessert menu I decided to end the meal with another duet, one a must order anywhere I see it and the other a must order at any Mexican restaurant but at $6 a piece I should have probably just ordered a margarita, entr\u00e9e, or another half-gallon of menudo instead.\n\nBeginning first with the rice pudding - a small bowl of relatively standard white rice with hints of cinnamon and orange subsequently dotted with golden raisins and curls of cinnamon plus, reportedly, \"Vanilla Kahlua sauce\" it would be hard to find a less flavorful dish containing such ingredients and with the rice cold and clumpy all I could do was wonder if I'd received the previous night's leftovers - a suspicion more or less confirmed when I tried the three milk cake, a dense and dry pound cake parfait made palatable only by the berries and most certainly not by the cream I can only guess came from a ready-whip can.  As a further note, where both dishes were advertised to contain nuts - specifically pecans, none were detected in either.\n\nNot one to complain except in the setting of egregious service or truly disastrous food I sat for a while with desserts unfinished watching the game still pondering how I'd spent so much on so little that impressed.

Formerly a pastry chef at Craftsteak and likely having fed me twice in that role it was a rather simple process of selecting personal favorites and paying a modest bill of $13 that led me back to the car with a half dozen selections and beginning with a freshly minted almond croissant it was love at first bite, the warm shattering layers and wispy yawning interior rife with natural almond flavors...no detectable frangipane, paste, or fillers...the best I've found in Vegas to date.  Moving next to the macarons, innovative flavors and excellent filling was unfortunately marred by cold temperatures but allowing the second half to warm proved an admirable bite, though not on par with the rest.  Taking a break and waiting until home for the rest a chocolate chip cookie served notice to a lovely rendition of the classic with dark and milk chips aplenty while the financier, in all its density and plump berries was Parisian textbook whether labeled 'tart' or not.  Last but not least, the puck of bread pudding received gentle treatment on a cast iron pan, griddled until custard began to melt, and filling my new kitchen with wafts of cinnamon and butter it will be remembered fondly as the first thing I ever 'cooked' in my house...and far better than anything I will actually cook anytime soon.", "business_id": "OIz-ANecBe-GOZVZZUHSXA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-12-17", "type": "review"}

If the store brand were a band that went on tour, I'd be right up with the rest of them, throwing my panties on stage.\n\nBut this location is a little odd. It's right across from Koreatown and when we went around 4PM there were literally seventeen cars in the parking lot. So if you want to avoid a crowd, this might be the one to go to.\n\nHowever, what is missing in customers is also missing in staff and selection. Store layout is a little odd, and the first thing you see when you walk in is the little food court area- which zero people went to while we were there. The store also lacks a produce department- they would probably increase their customers if they replaced the snack stand with a fresh produce area. But that's my completely unprofessional opinion.\n\nUsually I can spend my weight in cash on the women's fashion department, but here nothing was styled or really on display and nothing caught my eye- a rarity for Target stores.\n\nFound the basic items we needed, at prices we expect for this chain, but was just underwhelmed. Other reviews say this location feels vaguely dirty, and I see what they mean but I can't put my finger on why- it's not physically dirty, but the lighting seems a little dim and the store itself just isn't as cheerful as other locations.\n\nService was okay- we were stuck in line behind a couple who racked up a $200+ bill but couldn't seem to figure out which combination of credit cards and cash would cover their purchases. Cashier graciously offered to have us check out ahead of them while previous customers got their payment together, but we declined.

While I'm not sure if it was because of that, but the bartender would constantly come to the table and ask if we wanted another round. \n\nYeah, there's nothing like sobering up with more alcohol. And while their selection wasn't that great, they at least had New Castle. A classic favorite of mine. \n\nFound out that this place is a gathering spot for Minnesotans in the weekly sacrament of watching their Vikings play. For a second there I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing that Las Vegas would have a lot of Minnesota transplants.\n\nOh well, I guess the only real draw back to this place is that at the late hours you have to get buzzed in. I mean, that alone makes you feel like you're in a scummy area. Over all, a good little tavern to get your drink on when you want to escape the strip and all its madness.", "business_id": "tJhh6NDsNIwWMpxlP-0F7g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-05-03", "type": "review"}

It isn't just some \"pool party\" but a real event that happens between Memorial Day and Labor Day on Sundays.  It has gotten so popular that some folks won't go out on Saturday night so they can wake up in time to make this party.\n\nAnd easy way to get into Rehab is to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel.  Its expensive, but at least all guests are provided with a wristband that waives the pricey cover.  Bouncers are a little pretentious and have been that way ever since Rehab started catching on.  The prices for drinks are outrageous here and a cabana is almost out of the question for most low-rollers.  The cocktail waitresses work hard for their tips, its too bad this place has too many jerks and perverted gawkers to care.\n\nThe eye candy is certainly a big draw.

HAZE is not owned by Aria but by the Light Group which runs all of MGM / Mirage property clubs including Jet and the club at Hard Rock. If you've ever been mistreated at those clubs, now you know why. \n\nFirst, it's competition like someone mentioned is XS, Tryst, TAO and many other clubs that have amazing features such as beaches and pools, lagoons and pillars towering high above with gorgeous views of the strip. They have elegant and impressive bars and table areas. They have huge dance floors in multiple places and interesting tidbits like the girls in the bathtubs at TAO or the dancers at the pole at Tryst. Unfortunately for HAZE, they don't seem to have any of these features except for a small stage which divides the already small dance floor that contains a pole. They boast about having special shows that no other clubs have, but it's nothing more than going to a strip club on a B-grade night where a bald, head shaven female will come out and perform for you while hundreds watch on and wonder why she has no hair and is made up to look so scary instead of sexy.\n\nThis club is SMALL. It cannot hold many people and of all the people it does hold, its about 90% girls. No they will not go home with you nor will they party with you because they also have the same attitude as the bouncers in the front. Too. Good. For. You.\n\nIf you are a guy and you are trying to get in to this club, please save yourself some time and heartache because you will not get in even if you grease the bouncer $100+. If you get a table, you will have to deal with the fact that there's literally no space for you to dance and the waitress seems to be always missing so you can't get any service after paying $300 for a bottle of alcohol you can get from Costco in a bigger size for $55+tax. Even if you have 10 girls and 1 guy, the guy will get redirected to another line that will not move, and will be dispersed by the bouncers saying they are at capacity for people so cannot let anymore people in (but then will usher in 10 girl groups).\n\nDespite the poor layout, poor design, poor air quality and extremely expensive drinks (mixed drinks for $20? are you kidding me? not even the Wynn has these kinds of prices for a Vodka and Pineapple), HAZE tries to limit to zero the number of guys going into the club.\n\nLets step back for a second. If the girls get in free, and guys buy girls drinks, and guys are in the club to find girls and are willing to pay to find and buy these girls drinks ... aren't guys the STAPLE of the Las Vegas clubbing scene? So why is it that every other club has this figured out already except for the newest supposedly \"hippest\" club in town?\n\nRegardless, being a hotel guest I expected to have no problems getting in with the bf. We waited in line, like normal people would. We had VIP passes from our stay at Aria. We did not bitch, moan, complain or make a scene. Somehow, we were still separated after 45 minutes of waiting in line only to say that I could get in free but he would have to stay behind and wait in a line that may or may not get in at all. \n\nAnd when I tried to find someone to explain the situation where we were guests of the hotel, had waited for a long time, had VIP passes and there's no reason for me to be in a club by myself while he's out there waiting ... the main floor manager Mike cussed at me, shoved me physically and told me I had to get in or get out while completely being RUDE and did not listen to ANYTHING I had said. \n\nI understand Vegas is different, I understand guys have to pay more than girls, I understand they are trying to keep the girl to guy ratio high. What I don't understand is why someone has to be RUDE and use INAPPROPRIATE language in front of me when I have not done anything except ask if he could give me a minute so I could explain how I was frustrated at the situation. There's NO reason for him to put his hands on me, there is NO reason for him to be rude. \n\nPlease take your business elsewhere. HAZE is not worth your time, their attitude is not worth you having to put up with it, and you will have a far better time at XS or TAO once you find out that HAZE is nothing more than smoke and mirrors located in a dingy basement with some lighting, overpriced drinks, and no room at all to move.", "business_id": "JZWCBnrqU27DF8SOQq5yrw", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-03-15", "type": "review"}

They paid 300 bucks a night which was more than 1/3 of what we paid for.  Granted their suite was smaller but wow was it nicer.\n\nFirst off the wonderful view.  You're overlooking the new Aria/city center area, the paris tower is in the background and you're overlooking their pool.  The place is basically brand new.  It came with all of the newest  amenities: projectors, LCDs, remote controlled curtains, everything controlled by a single remote.\n\nThe shower had 2 shower heads, they had a full kitchen, with a refrig that dispensed filtered water.

The shows were actually quite different.  Mystere seems more like a high-end circus with a great display of athletic and acrobatic feats.  Ka seems more like a cinematic drama with great interweaving of acrobatic feats and techniques (in some ways reminiscent of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon).\n\nBoth are worthwhile in their own ways, but I guess which one you favor most depends on your personal preferences.  I personally liked Ka more.  It felt much more special and the production values were great.  It also felt like something you would have to be in Vegas to see.  Mystere is nice, but it definitely feels like a show that can be performed in many venues and not just Vegas.\n\nMystere is impressive though.  There is an aerial cube, which shows a man managing a cube with his arms and legs in mid-air.  There was also a great aerial tissu (ribbon) where a female acrobat does various rhythmic poses and moves in mid-air.  They utilized Chinese poles for one act (reminiscent of an early scene from Ocean's Eleven).\n\nThere was also a trampoline, which was a lot of fun--both humorous and exciting.  I also liked the trapeze though it got a little repetitive.  The most impressive act though was the hand-to-hand poses that two men performed--various handstands, grips and poses (it was probably the most impressive display of strength, balance and flexibility I've ever seen).\n\nThere was also little comedic acts here and there though I did not think they were that great (the acts were more cute than funny).\n\nIn terms of ticket prices, Mystere is reasonable.  The show has been around for a while, so you can probably find reasonable prices for Mystere (either at one of those discount ticket booths on The Strip or simply from the Mystere box office).\n\nI did not try any of the concessions, but service seemed fine; there was a very long line to get into the theater, but the line moved relatively fast.  The theater itself was too hot, which made the show a tad uncomfortable.\n\nMystere is an okay Vegas show.  There are definitely some amazing displays of talent, but the show got a little boring for me.  I personally preferred Ka because the story was more interesting and the production values were much better (still, there is probably a better display of acrobatics in Mystere).  As I already mentioned, how much you like Mystere will probably depend on your personal preferences, but it is definitely a show that provides entertainment at a good value for Vegas (probably less expensive than most of the other Cirque shows on The Strip).\n\nMystere is located in the Treasure Island hotel and casino.  I believe Treasure Island like other casinos features free parking (whether by valet or structure).", "business_id": "DqY2VlbRuQ3Mu2mlxd4xUQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-06-20", "type": "review"}

Grand in both scope and spectacle with ornate glass, open floorplans, and plush seating complimented by a staff of over twelve-dozen overseeing preparation, service, and customer needs my arrival at Bacchanal shortly preceded its 8am opening and greeted first by a cheerful cashier, then by assistant manager Stephanie, my experience commenced; the subsequent three hours adrift in 70+ of the buffet's offerings and a sea of smiles emanating from each employee and nearly every patron.  Divided into several sections with many offering cooked-to-order options including crepes and omelets it was Asian that my meal began and with fresh steamer baskets just opened the dim sum excelled - a small quibble in the thick-skinned har gow more than compensated by bao, duck and pork as good as that at Jasmine plus full-service congee complete with century egg, not to mention Sin City's best Egg Custard Tart later discovered at the dessert island.  Moving next to things more \"American,\" one is well advised to monitor for items fresh from the kitchen as both the crunchy waffles and well seasoned chicken proved superlative while later tastes of waffle fries and tots fell flat - a fresh buttermilk biscuit, hot seafood preparations, and sliced meats including smoky beef ribs with caramelized crunch all showing far better.  At times a touch liberal in salt with Kung Pao Chicken and Risotto suffering the most, Bacchanal again shines in selections of shellfish, cheese, and charcuterie but with much eating to do and such things widely available elsewhere it was thoroughly in my sweet tooth that I indulged and although I passed up a few cookies plus a duo of sorbet suffice it to say that I nearly ran the gamut; cakes, doughnuts, pies, tarts, and more all justifying the calories with the aforementioned egg custard, pecan pie, cream puff, carrot cake, and citrus 'tiramisu' all warranting special mention along with the lovely pastry team who jovially tended to baking, saucing, arranging, and making crepes at a pace seldom to lull.\n\nSlightly more expensive than Wicked Spoon but making up the difference in complimentary champagne there are things to love about both of Las Vegas' premier all-you-can-eat experiences yet aside from a more expansive gelato case and my predilection to The Cosmopolitan's soundtrack I'd be hard-pressed to ever recommend it over Bacchanal.  Obviously limited by the constraints intrinsic to feeding anywhere from 2500 to 4500 persons in a given day yet defying the odds through a combination of remarkable customer service and striking attention to detail I'm happy to say that Bacchanal lives up to the liberally applied superlatives and although \"Gods\" may require something slightly more refined I'm almost positive they won't find it in such a format for less than $50, especially on Las Vegas Boulevard.", "business_id": "sIyHTizqAiGu12XMLX3N3g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-06-01", "type": "review"}

The decor reminds me a little bit of the Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill in MGM Grand in how the restaurant is very much open to the casino and the hotel.  There are no big and thick walls separating the dining area from the nearby bustling activity of the casino.\n\nThe decor is very upscale cafe-like and hotel restaurant-like.  Nice and contemporary but pretty standard stuff (not unique or memorable).\n\nWe had a few things here and I felt the food looked better than it tasted.  Several of the dishes were average.  I was not a big fan of Fleur by Hubert Keller (a tapas spot in Mandalay Bay), but I felt Fleur was noticeably better than Julian Serrano.\n\nHere is a rundown on what we had.\n\n(Ahi Tuna Tempura) This was ahi tuna two ways.  There was a standard ahi tuna tower on the plate that had an avocado base (fresh and a good flavor but something you will find at a lot of other restaurants).\n\nThere was also ahi tuna that was flash fried in a light tempura batter (crispy on the outside but still rare on the inside).  This was okay and I liked the contrast of the cool center with the crisp outside.  Still, I've had a much better version of that dish at Ocean Avenue Seafood in Santa Monica.\n\n(Mediterranean Bass)  This was a bass with the skin-on that was served over some veggies with a light sauce.  It was a light dish and had a mild flavor.  The fish was pretty moist (the skin could have been crisper).\n\n(Cheese Platter) The cheese selection at Fleur was much better.  The cheese here was a little dry (not great flavors either).  The garnishes were also disappointing.  The fruit paste was too thick and lacked sweetness.\n\n(Chicken Skewers) The chicken skewers here were juicy enough, but they lacked flavor.\n\n(Prime Tenderloin Topped With Cheese, Honey And Pecans) The quality of beef was really poor (at least when compared to the other dishes we had here). The beef was a thin piece.  They overcooked it  (it came out well) and it was dry and chewy.  The cheese, honey and pecans were all fine, but the centerpiece of the dish (beef) was a real disappointment.\n\n(Stuffed Dates) The dates here were wrapped in bacon and then deep-fried.  This is a pretty popular combination and their version of it was pretty tasty (though kind of a given with this flavor combination).\n\nService was okay.  Food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive enough, but I felt the wait staff was not as strong as what I experienced at other Vegas spots recently (including Fleur, Mesa Grill, Comme Ca, Bouchon, and Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill).\n\nI've been fortunate enough to have a lot of service where it felt the wait staff was really putting in the extra effort to make every aspect of the dining experience enjoyable and memorable.  While the wait staff was pleasant enough, I did not get that same feeling here.\n\nJulian Serrano sounds like it would be a nice place.  The menu reads nice as well.  There were mostly misses here though and the food was just not as good as other Vegas spots I've tried in the same price range.  I will give a lot of places a second try, but since we had so many dishes and so many were average, I doubt I would return here.\n\nAria features complimentary valet parking.

So the kitchen wasn't very busy which might explain the poor timing. And as for the spiciness of the Pad Thai, perhaps the gal taking my order should have asked me if I wanted it spicy?

Opting next to explore the section entitled \"French Toast and Waffles\" with a pair of the former the plates that arrived would prove even more impressive than round one; both \"breads\" actually sliced cakes dipped in custard and griddled golden, the carrot lacking much vegetable but rich with spice while the tangy poppy seed version served as base to the unbridled flavor of fresh strawberries in a dessert-come-breakfast take on a summertime favorite that should not be missed.", "business_id": "DW6SI2KxcfXBHeo9jEr4lQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-06-08", "type": "review"}

This place has potential, but thus far that potential is not fully realized.\n\nseven plates, four desserts...and a $1 'bread supplement'\n\n\"Shrimp and Grits,\" a savory and intense composition of sweet and snappy head-on shrimp atop creamy popcorn grits enlivened by charred onions and smoky pork glaze with a touch on honey.  Sweet and savory but perhaps a bit steep at $14 this was a dish where the ingredients and the execution came together beautifully.\n\n\"Arizona Ricotta, Sicilian Pistachio Toast, Roasted Radish\" at $8 arrived as a trio with only a single flaw - a dearth of salt to liven up the otherwise beautifully cooked radish.  A bit of a disappointment even despite the high quality of the tender taproot the dish certainly improved in moving on to the bread crisps as the ricotta was ever so slightly melted while the bread itself was herbal and crunchy but at the same time subtle.  With a bit more salt this one could be great.\n\nFor Duck Confit Meatballs, Foie Gras, White Bean, Tomato Agrodolce it would be hard to say exactly how/why such decadent ingredients did not live up to my expectations, particularly as the meatballs were tender and rife with flavor, but if I had to pin it on one thing I think it would be the expectations arising with the word \"Foie Gras\" and the $14 price tag as the sapor of the foie was largely lost to the tomatoes while the puree of white bean was okay, but mostly just filler.\n\nBerkshire Pork Belly, Kimchee, Udon Noodle, Fried Egg arrived with some joking at the table about the ubiquity of pork belly these days and as much as I cannot argue that said ingredient is delicious I just didn't find it well utilized here as the fattiness of the swine simply overwhelmed any semblance of kimchee while the noodles were soggy and limp.  Decent flavors though garnished by a rather inconsequential egg I had a few bites and that was enough.\n\n\"Maine Lobster Fried Rice, Mullet Egg, Aji Amarillo\" was actually a rather nice plate of risotto with a lot of umami and a touch of heat but \"fried rice\" it most certainly was not.  Nice enough, but certainly not a sharable plate, one of my tablemates summed it up perfectly when he commented that all this dish really did was make him want to go elsewhere and get a dish of \"kick ass\" fried rice - something he could have done at 1/3 the tab and had enough for lunch the next day.\n\nMoving last to a pair of sides, each $6 and far more generous than the rice, Grilled and Buttered Shiitake Mushrooms, Truffle Honey along with Grilled Broccoli Carbonara, Pancetta, Egg, Black Pepper arrived and where the first showed strongly in its simplicity the second fell flat once again due to a lack of salt - a lack so pronounced that frozen broccoli straight from the bag has more flavor thus making me wonder exactly what sort of pancetta was even present.\n\nButtermilk Blackberry Crumb Cake arrived as a dense butter cake with a downhome toothsomeness that I really enjoyed, but with ample notes of buttermilk dominating the sweetness of the berries I think this one could have benefitted from one of two things - a dollop of ice cream or a cup of coffee.  I'd definitely order this as a breakfast item anywhere.\n\nCaramel Apple Upside Down Cake, Salted Caramel, and Pistachio Ice Cream.  A long and linear presentation with the apple flavor a bit overwhelmed by the salty caramel but still potent and tart what truly made this plate shine was the ice cream - creamy, rich, and rife with nutty flavor...had we been dining earlier I'd have probably driven over to Sweet Republic for another round.\n\nUnder other circumstances Sacher Torte would have been the highlight of the meal and served with \"Toasted Almond Amaretto Mascarpone Mousse\" this one was a fine example.  Dense, intensely cocoa, and appropriately dry without suffering the Americanization of making it too birthday-cake in texture this was another dessert that would have gone great with coffee but the use of the mousse and bold apricot flavor kept everything balanced and bright.  It was awesome.\n\nIf there is one thing The House should keep doing from this point until the day they close their doors it should be keeping the Butterscotch Pudding on the menu.  A fan of all puddings - from rice to bread to budino - and having had a number of similar presentations elsewhere this version was simply outstanding - sweet and salty, dense and creamy, and bespeckled with chocolate and fruit adding both texture and flavor.  It goes on the short list for Phoenix's best desserts and will likely remain there for some time.\n\nOverall, The House is off to a decent start but still has a lot of room for growth in every department except perhaps dessert and d\u00e9cor.  A lovely setting already with great service I think the focus should start with improved seasoning and working to nail the basics before experimenting with 'fusion' and once the kitchen is hitting on all cylinders perhaps improving the portion/price ratio.", "business_id": "eXaVJc5GMIjYEUjbrc13FA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-10-20", "type": "review"}

The original Comme Ca in LA can be good or quite average (depending on what you order).  The Vegas location features a pretty similar menu (the same good/average may apply).\n\nThis Comme Ca has a much better decor/atmosphere.  I've always felt the Comme Ca in LA has really just inhabited its location rather than transformed it.  The layout and design is so much more well thought out here as it combines both French brasserie characteristics and modern touches (which is kind of like the menu--classic French bistro re-imagined for a contemporary audience). \n\nThe room at lunchtime also takes advantage of its Vegas location.  They use floor-to-ceiling windows that bring in a lot of warm natural light (as well as provide a good view of nearby casinos).  I think there is also an outdoor dining area, which probably incorporates The Strip even more.\n\nFor food, the meal began with a complimentary French baguette--similar to the one they serve in LA but not as good.  It was freshly baked and warm; however, the crust was a little too hard and the bread was too chewy.\n\nI went with the 3-course lunch pre fixe ($32).  They give you a good variety of choices in entrees as well as a decent variety in starters and desserts.\n\nI started with the endive and watercress salad that was garnished with blue cheese, julienne apple, roasted walnuts, and a sprightly vinaigrette.  The endives were fresh and crisp (great snap to them).  The watercress was also fresh and good.  The combination made for a good salad base.\n\nThe garnishes were good.  The walnuts provided a good crunch while the green apple gave the salad a good tart flavor.  I also liked the blue cheese, which had a good creaminess to it and was not too pungent, but there was not much of it.  The salad was nicely dressed with the vinaigrette.  It was a light tossing, which kept all the ingredients crisp and not soggy.  Still, the vinaigrette was a little acidic.\n\nFor my entree, I went with the Scottish Salmon that came with artisanal polenta and oyster mushrooms.  It was a decent portion for a lunch entree.  The salmon was moist and had a good outside sear.  The outside sear had a good flavor, which made it feel like they left the skin-on (even though they didn't).  Salmon can have a strong fish flavor and this one certainly did.\n\nThe polenta was creamy and pretty good though polenta is not my favorite side.  There was also a mild cream sauce that did not really do much.  There were also some oyster mushrooms on the plate, which were nicely cooked and not rubbery.  Unfortunately, they were incredibly salty.\n\nFor dessert, I went with the profiteroles.  Like the LA Comme Ca, the profiteroles at lunch were not the standard profiteroles filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with a dark chocolate sauce.  Instead, they filled the profiteroles with Chantilly cream and then topped them with vanilla ice cream and a crystallized sugar garnish.  They then poured a dark chocolate sauce over top of it.\n\nThe presentation was nicer than the LA Comme Ca's lunch dessert.  Also, the dark chocolate sauce was thinner and had a much better and smoother flavor (but still rich).  The vanilla ice cream was good and creamy.  I liked the crystallized sugar garnish, which provided a good sweetness and crispy contrast.\n\nThe profiteroles though were not the type of profiteroles I am used to; the profiteroles here were quite small.  They were very crisp on the outside and were not light, airy and soft on the inside.  They tasted more like a cross between a profiterole and a brioche cookie/biscuit.  I saw a photo on Yelp where the profiteroles looked to have the appropriate size and texture so it might just have been the day I went.  The Chantilly cream filling was good.\n\nThe waitress (Andrea) seemed new (it is a new restaurant after all) and very trained.  She did a good job.  She was pleasant, personable, polite, and very attentive throughout the course of the meal.  She also (though this didn't really impact the overall dining experience) looked very similar to an actress, but I couldn't pinpoint who.\n\nComme Ca's $32 3-course lunch prix fixe is a good deal especially when you consider all the overpriced restaurants in Vegas.  In terms of their regular prices, the prices here are about what you would expect to pay at Bouchon (The Venetian); since they are both French bistros, they have many similar items.  The food at Comme Ca might be slightly less.\n\nIf you haven't been to the Comme Ca in LA, this one is a decent lunch option for Vegas.  The food was not spectacular, but there was consistent quality with each dish (the mushrooms being the exception).  If you've been to the Comma Ca in LA, You may want to branch out and try something new since the menu is similar.\n\nComplimentary parking via valet; parking structure may also be available.", "business_id": "NxsCqQCpofRx08m535JYIA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-30", "type": "review"}

They have multiple locations all throughout the stadium, which make them very easy to find.  They serve the traditional baseball stadium food like hot dogs, french fries and popcorn.  There are some items that are only available at some of the Double Headers stands though (like the nachos).  I am not sure, but I think some of the Double Headers also sell a foot-long corn dog.\n\nDouble Headers does provide one big advantage over many arena/stadium concessions stands.  They have a value menu that features items like hot dogs, corn dogs and popcorn for $1.50 each.  We went with the popcorn and it was okay.  It was not super light or super fresh, but it was perfectly serviceable.  It was a decent size too.  That size of popcorn would probably run about $4 at a movie theater concessions stand.\n\nWe also went with the nachos, which were corn tortilla chips topped with jalapenos and a side of melted nacho cheese.  The chips were the kind of hearty gold tortilla chips that you would get from a grocery store.  They were crunchy, but they were not the freshest chips.\n\nThe jalapenos were good and the nacho cheese here was better than what you would find at most arenas/stadiums.  The nacho cheese had a little bit of spice and heat to it.  That is rare for stadium cheese dips.

It is a remarkably good airport given the tremendous growth in the Valley of the Sun. \n\nThere are 3 terminals: \nTerminal 2, the smallest and oldest, (United, Continental, others)\nTerminal 3, next largest and oldest (Delta, Northwest and many others, including international flights)\nTerminal 4, newest and bigger than the others combined, dominated by SouthWest and US AIrways (formerly America West)\n\nFor locals, there are the West and East long term parking lots. You can park in the West and walk to Terminal 2; East is much larger with an annex and hi-rise, and closer to terminal 4, but you need to take the shuttles. To help you remember which is east and west, PHX names the shuttles Gecko, RoadRunner, and one other I can't remember! \n\nFor visitors, to get a round the sprawling valley, you need to rent a car. The recently added offsite Rental car Center is huge and well organized into 4 floors with different brands on each floor, and a lot of shuttle buses that are dedicated to each terminal. It is about 1 mile from the airport, but allow 10 minutes for shuttles and loading when you drop off your car. \n\nThey have recently upgraded Terminal 2, expanding the security area and remodeling the restaurant. Terminal 2 has little in the way of food and shops. Terminal 4, organized into 7 separate buildings of gates connected with long hallways and moving sidewalks, has more food and shopping choices, but not on the order of PDX, or DEN. Because of the sheer volume of flights, Term 4 can have a long security check-in line, so plan accordingly. \n\nIf you have questions, there are roaming information assistant volunteers, wearing blue sports coats and hats. Signage is decent and most monitors have been upgraded to flat screens. \n\nSky Harbor is located close to Tempe (ASU) and no too far from downtown PHX. The edge of Mesa and Scottsdale are about 5 miles away, but it is 20 or more miles from other parts of North Scottsdale, Deer Valley and North Phoenix. Overall, it is fairly well organized and a clean airport with a lot of flight options, especially on SouthWest or US Airways, who use it as a major hub. For other airlines with a smaller foothold, you have to often connect through LAX, DEN, SLC, ORD or SFO depending on your final destination.", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-11-17", "type": "review"}

Little did I know, they also have quite a few Waffle Houses throughout the greater Phoenix area.\n\nAdmittedly, I hadn't seen Waffle Houses this far west, let alone in desert climate. Being that I was also traveling with two west coast friends who hadn't (ever) had Waffle House, suddenly  the desire for greasy, cheap food was appealing - not just for the sake of folks who hadn't had it, but also because we could say we had Waffle House in Arizona.\n\nWalking into the place, it was evident we were in the right company, as the place was crawling with people from Auburn University. The BCS National Championship (#2) brought out many of the orange and navy faithful out west, only to go for a reminder of home in the Waffle House. For a hot minute I felt like I was in Auburn, AL.\n\nThe look and feel of this Waffle House was on par with virtually every other experience I've had: the molasses speed of the service, the grittiness of the interior with the smell of grease in the air, the ghastly bathrooms, and Southern patrons. The prices felt a tad higher, but I imagine they just creep up the further west one goes (#3).\n\nIn the end, it comes down to the food. Waffle House is a destination for those who seek greasy food at cheapo prices during all hours of the day/night. Yet, for throughout our meal, most of the food was just bland. My biscuits and gravy were definitely lacking seasoning and my beloved hash browns were surprisingly on the bland side. I could tell my friends were scurrying along with their meal of grits and raisin toast and hardly raving about their food.\n\nOne could blame it on the fact I was in Arizona, but it still is technically the South (west).

I'll rephrase for the supposed masses.\n\nIf you enjoy eating hot dogs, you'll want to make D's a destination when hanging in the 'burgh. It's a great place to go and get some tubed meat in a variety of different mix and match combinations and also a great place to meet new people... perhaps you'll even meet someone who shares your love of you eating hot dogs and you can shower them with many moments of which they can watch you eat your beloved wieners and y'all can live happily ever after. \n\nNo? Ugh, fine. Then just eat the damn hot dog all by your lonesome. See if I care.\n\nI came in with a group of friends for a semi-liquid lunch and though it was the beer cave that brought us in, I was secretly more excited about watching my friends eat hot dogs. You see, I'd been feeling super sick for the entire duration on my Pittsburgh road trip. I think it was a bad Cholera strain. Anyway, my party of six allowed me to sleep in extra late while they wandered around some graveyard by our hotel with scones until I was all puked out and ready see what the light of day looks like. I was feeling bummed that I had to hibernate through my original morning plan of going to the zoo, but the thought getting to see my pals suck down chili dogs all Jack & Diane style really helped lift my spirits.\n\nWe walked in, sat down and I was immediately excited to be sitting across from their epic celebrity mural. It's like a pop-culture/history 'Where's Waldo', only there's no Waldo, and instead Gandalf, Wolverine, John Candy, and more. I spent the entire time between ordering and the food coming out staring at the wall and finding new peeps. My only gripe on the artwork is that the mural was seriously lacking in Bill Murray biz-nasty, so for that I have to subtract a star. Okay, no. I'm only (half) joking about the star thing. I'm actually deducting the star because their veggie dog was pretty damn terrible. I mean, the toppings (I got the chihuahua with cheese and jalapenos) were fine, but I think I've microwaved dogs that tasted better than theirs. It was so freaking rubbery and tough and chewy... like bad calamari or trying to chew a whole pack of rock hard Bazooka Joe at once. My jaw was tired from trying to force my tearing teeth into that little soy sausage but the worst part is that I had to devote so much extra time to eating my stupid wiener that I missed being able to watch my friends eat their hot dogs. Boo-urns. Next time, I'll skip the veggie dog and go with a wrap or pizza or burger or something that'll allow for more wiener-peeping.\n\nOn the other hand, the veggie pub fries were damn good and something I resented having to offer to share them with my friends... but I did offer because I felt like it would detract from them getting 'weirded out' at my wanting to gawk at them like I bought a ticket to watch them eat hot dogs... even though that wishful thought didn't pan out anyway thanks to the lackluster veg-dog I ended up with. \n\nTheir beer selection was stellar and their beer cave in back was a fun shopping experience and great place to find a few rarities. They actually had the Rogue Voodoo Doughnut bombers that you can hardly ever find. Unfortunately, my sickness impaired me from imbibing and I actually spent the latter half of the time there barfing in the bathroom (not to the fault of D's) while my friends shopped for a bevy of beer in the cave. Also worth mentioning is how friendly everyone here was.

The stage is in the center of the theater, and Jamie W. and I were in the front row being pummeled by windblown sheets, plastic bricks and various paraphernalia coming from the vaunted ceiling. \n\nIt's all good fun if rather loud.

THIS is art I can get down with. \n\nOn a brief visit to Pittsburgh, this was one of top items on our very limited 'To-Do' list. We opted to skip the Warhol Museum and 'go to the Mattresses' because it seemed a bit more dynamic and also, I'll be honest, cheaper. \n\nNow, I'm not an art fanatic by any means. I look at it, I see things, I don't feel any emotional attachment, nothing's stirred, nothing moves me. I'm just dead inside. It's just a thing I'm looking at, that means zilch to me, though I'd be more than happy to assign anything 'art' a number from 1-10 to accurately show how boring or not boring I find it. Ignorant? Yes. Most definitely. But it's honest and I'd like to think there's a bit of honor in coming clean over bullshitting through some phony explanation of why something I really don't care for is or isn't poignant, and with that being said I liked the Mattress Factory because it didn't feel like a stuffy art museum. It was fun, you could move about almost freely, no guards, just guides and at points you're even encouraged to explore and touch. \n\nWhat I liked about the Mattress factory was that it had a sense of humor. It wasn't all serious all the time as we quickly discovered upon entering the 'Breast in the Press' installation, consisting of a dark room with an absolutely enormous statue of a topless woman with comically huge breasts and a music video being projected in onto each boob to the tune of 'My Humps' by the Black-Eyed Peas, but with the words changed and the large-breasted creator of the work singing topless while smashing her inked up breasts against sheets of paper at a desk, as if she was writing the news with her fun bags. This was an exhibit we saw back in November/December, and still, if I hear any clip of 'My Humps', I can't help but think of the Mattress Factory titty song. \n\nAnother exhibit we walked into and 'accidentally' crushed part of. I use mini-quotes for the word 'accidentally' because at first I really did step on one of the ping pong balls littering the rectangular room on accident, but then when it popped and no one from the museum came out to yell at me I took it as free reign to do it again... and again, and again, and again and then eventually I just started picking them up started throwing them at my friends- triple words score if you hit in the testiculars! Anyway, I don't know what the artist wanted me to get from the exhibit, but I just assumed it was a test in seeing how long it took a regular museum-goer to turn delinquent and start wrecking sh*t. \n\nThe exhibits using light were really cool. All optical illusion-y and the one pitch black room where you're only supposed to go two-at-a-time was great for scaring friends. We had a truce to not creep up or bad touch anyone in the exhibit, but of course we all failed to withhold our end of the treaty and it went from a silent 2-person exhibit to a screeching, poking, fondling, scary exhibit. Again, I don't know what I was supposed to take away from it, but somehow we all ended up interpreting it as the another 'break the rules' room. \n\nThe doll room was creepy, but cool. As a hoarder, I appreciated being able to show my friends one place that might be scarier than mess-menagerie at my own place. Now maybe I'll invite them over. \n\nThe room with the water was fun to jump from stone to stone and throw rocks and the sound thing hanging from the ceiling was neat if you were lucky enough to be by while someone walked over it from the floor above, but they should really make the 'Do not touch' sign bigger if they really don't want you to touch it, because I did not see that sh*t till my hands already gave it a good touch.\n\nThe mirror room was the best part next to boobs. It's kind of silly, but it felt more interactive because you have to either take your shoes off or put mesh booties on to enter. It basically a bunch of colors and dots and mirrors and a few mannequins, but you can see yourself from all angles and somehow it was more fun than a standard dressing room, though it was basically the same, but with more decoration. Our group probably would've stayed here all day if there wasn't another group waiting to go in. \n\nThere's more to the museum than just the one building, if you leave there's an outdoor area that was awesome because I saw a lizard go down the well thing and then I tried to catch it but I almost fell in the mud and my friends were ready to move on and climb other stuff, then if you go down the back alley/parking lot, around the corner and down up the road, you just flash your badge/ticket stub and you can see their other exhibit made up of odd housing installations. It wasn't reveting, but I liked the little hidden words and phrases found throughout the house. It felt like getting the fortune slip out of a fortune cookie, but without having to eat it. \n\nIf you're in Pittsburgh, defo pencil in the Mattress Factory for a 2-hour art excursion.", "business_id": "mtchqm9cDlMewP8A_enSzg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-02-25", "type": "review"}

I am not sure why they made the change.  Maybe it was due to the economy and they wanted to provide something less expensive and more approachable.\n\nI never visited Fleur de Lys, but the decor seems similar.  Contemporary room with a warm feel.  High ceilings provide an open feel.  There is enough spacing between the tables to make conversation easy.  The wall still has the Fleur de Lys' wall decor (stones and rose decoration).  They have swapped out the white tablecloth for simple lacquered wood tables.\n\nWe tried several dishes, which were all well presented.  While most (if not all) of the dishes were probably cooked and tasted okay, they were not very memorable.  Also, the portions were dainty (even for tapas) so the food felt a little pricey.  Here is a rundown on what we tried.\n\n(Cheese Platter - 4.5 stars) One of the best cheese dishes I've had.  They had a great assortment of cheeses that ranged in flavor and texture (including a pungent cheese that was presented in delicate ruffled layers like exotic mushroom petals).  Good toasts (including a sweet fruit and nut toast).  There were also good garnishes including honey, a fruit paste and a grape salad (that actually looked a lot better than it tasted).\n\n(Tiramisu - 4 stars) The tiramisu was good--nice cream, good coffee flavor and good ladyfingers.  Simple but satisfying.  The dessert was served with biscotti, which was just okay.\n\n(Tuna Tacos - 4 stars) These little crunchy tacos featured raw tuna, jalapeno, lime cilantro, and cabbage.  Good flavor, fresh and nice contrasting textures.  It was good but would not be among the best tuna dishes I've had.\n\n(Peking Duck - 3.5 stars) The duck breast was served with sauteed greens, caramelized pearl onions and date puree.  The flavors were mostly sweet and good; the greens did provide a little bitterness.  The duck was pink and juicy though not the best quality; the skin could have been more crisp.\n\n(Skirt Steak Topped With Chimchurri, Fingerling Baked Potato And Heirloom Tomato Salad - 3.5 stars) The heirloom tomato salad was fresh and was dressed in a vibrant vinaigrette.  The very tiny fingerling baked potato was topped with creme fraiche and chives.  It was okay, but when something is that small and cute, it needs to be great.  The skirt steak was juicy and tasty.\n\n(Yukon Gold Potato & Veal Ravioli - 3.5 stars) The pasta was very thin (almost translucent) and looked like Asian dumplings.  The inside veal filling was okay but not great.  It tasted pretty good though.  It was served with Tallegio cheese, which had a great flavor.\n\n(Panna Cotta With Berries Compote And Sorbet - 3 stars) The vanilla panna cotta was creamy and light, but it was overwhelmed by the heavy topping of strong and tart berries.  The sorbet was a little too icy.\n\n(Foie Gras Mousse With Huckleberry Gelee - 3 stars) The cold foie gras mousse was served in a glass and was topped with a gelee of sweet huckleberry (and accompanied by brioche toasts).  Good mix of salty and sweet but nothing spectacular.\n\n(Hummus And Baba Ganoush - 2.5 stars) One of the dips had a strong garlic flavor (can't remember which one).  Served with pita bread.  Okay but pretty standard stuff.\n\n(Angus Sliders With Red Onion, Cheese And Pear - 2.5 stars) The sliders featured juicy meat and good housemade buns.  There was too much onion though; it was overpowering.  There was a little bit of thin matchstick fries, which were just okay.\n\n(Chocolate Souffle With Chocolate Ganache And Mango Ice Cream - 2.5 stars) The chocolate souffle looked great.  Great rise and a nice design (fleur) on top.  The souffle was not right though--it was way too spongy.  Also, the chocolate ganache tasted burnt.  The ice cream was creamy and good.\n\n(Cheesecake Lollipops - 2 stars) These firm cheesecake lollipops were decorated with graham crackers and chocolate.  They looked good, but they were just okay.\n\n(Salt Cod Fritters - 2 stars) These lightly breaded hush puppies did not have a great fish center--mostly bread.  The outside was kind of soft.  While the fritters were not bland, they had a pretty boring flavor.  The romesco dipping sauce was thick and did not improve the dish.\n\nService was very good.  Great staff with many friendly, polite and attentive team members.\n\nIf Fleur was a little cheaper and the portions were bigger, I would have liked it more.  The food was decent, but if the food tasted as good as it looked, I would have walked away much more satisfied.  Still, Fleur was significantly better than the other Vegas tapas spot I tried--Julian Serrano at Aria.\n\nLocated in Mandalay Bay, parking is complimentary (valet or self-parking structure).", "business_id": "N50HceZf1595UtU867u4uQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-13", "type": "review"}

At dinner I imagine this place is a solid 5.\n\nArriving toward the end of the lunch hour we entered Carnevino dressed casually - a tad out of place compared to the all black and white clad service staff.  Seated promptly and greeted by Josh nearly the moment we were seated the service never faltered throughout our stay - water was refilled rapidly, dishes served impeccably, and bread service...we'll get to that later.  Browsing around the large room and high ceilings, dark woods, and white tablecloths covering widely spaced tables the restaurant definitely felt very Batali - and the soundtrack of Beatles, Eagles, The Who, and Stones coming from the front of the house left no doubt.\n\nMy buddies having already begun their daily drinking at the tables and myself a non drinker we all opted for water - water with ice and multiple refills.  After taking orders and heading to the kitchen we were brought the first of a couple rounds of dinner rolls.  Tasting the incredibly complex sweet yet salty and crisp exterior which yielded a pillow-soft interior not unlike a croissant I inquired of our server what exactly constituted these delicious pieces of carbohydrate - lardo, butter, flour, yeast, and \"a bit of parmesan\" I was informed.\n\nAllowed to sit and chat for a while before our mains arrived I joked with my buddies about the fact that we had gone to, arguably, the best steak restaurant in Vegas and neither had ordered a steak - one opting for the Tuna caponata, cocoa agro dolce and the other choosing The Burger with pancetta and onion cheddar and arugula salad.  Stating that steak was a \"dinner food' I clearly realized that I needed more epicurean friends.  All joking aside, both of them loved their meal and their dishes looked and smelled excellent  - while my one friend didn't prefer the cocoa accents to his tuna he loved the fish and my other friend stated the burger was the best he'd ever tasted.\nFor myself, the decisions for this meal were based on previous Batali experience and both dishes wowed - as expected.  Served together since neither of my friends opted for an appetizer the first dish was from the dinner anti-pasti menu and was entitled \"House-Cured Pastrami\" with local duck egg and emerald butter lettuce.  While I generally don't prefer beef textures, particularly \"lunch meats\" such as pastrami I was told by Mr. Feit that this dish was more like beef bacon and was made from the dry-aged stock of BBL beef.  Trusting his judgement I have to admit this dish was very impressive with the pastrami truly being like a clean and spicy pork bacon in texture - great fattiness and almost melt in the mouth texture despite its somewhat dehydrated nature.  Accompanying the pastrami - a single duck egg sunny side up alongside a delicate and dare-I-say \"buttery\" lettuce.  Atop the dish was a combination of aged balsamic, olive oil, cracked pepper, and pan juices from the slight pan-kissing of the pastrami.  Breaking the yolk of the egg the dish was given a creamy contrast to the other sharp, spicy, and acidic flavors and truly impressed.\n\nThe second dish, also requested from the dinner menu, was entitled Sweetbreads \"al boscaiolo\" which according to my server meant \"lumberjack style.\"  Served with pan seared mixed/chopped mushrooms, fresh peas, spinach, and a reduction of honey, rosemary, and perhaps sage the sweetbreads were perfectly flash fried to retain their creamy texture and without a bit of brine.  Clearly using a bit of salt, pepper, and perhaps cheese in the crispy coating the sweetbreads on their own would have been superb - but pairing their creamy and spicy preparation with the crisp yet mildly sweet greens, woody and smooth mushrooms, and heavily accented honey made the dish a truly one of a kind experience - while not as \"refined\" as Guy Savoy's preparation the night prior these may have actually been my favorite sweetbread preparation all time - or at least on par with the versions at Alex, Savoy, and (as much as I dislike admitting it) Michael Symon's Lola.\n\nFinishing up our meals we were told that the dessert menu at lunch was limited to cheeses and ice creams and as such we deferred - too bad since the peach fritters and roasted spiced dates sounded excellent.  Settling the tab the meal was actually my cheapest lunch or dinner in Vegas yet extremely rewarding.  While I could've certainly done without the Eagles (I hate the f&%ckin' Eagles Man! - Lebowski) the service was excellent and accommodating from e-mail all the way to leaving the restaurant and the food was superb.", "business_id": "3MmHmJXr8Ltk_Z5EGE4KUw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-12", "type": "review"}

Unfortunately, most of them are very expensive and simply not that good.  They tend to feature menus that do not change that often and the food quality is just mediocre at best.  There are some exceptions.  MGM Grand's L'atelier de Joel Robuchon features exceptionally creative and modern French cuisine that embraces French flavors and techniques while losing the richness and heaviness to deliver more vibrant and lighter cuisine. And Mario Batali's Carnevino (in the Palazzo) serves very good and thick cuts of beef though the sides, (most of their) pastas and desserts underwhelm.\n\nBatali's other high-end Las Vegas restaurant (B&B Ristorante) is also located in The Palazzo / Venetian, but it focuses on Italian starters, pastas and entrees and not the steakhouse fare of Carnevino.  B&B Ristorante immediately reminds me of Batali's Osteria Mozza in Los Angeles.  The menus look the same (and some of the dishes even seem very similar).  A pasta tasting menu is offered at both spots.  And the decor at both places are similar--lots of dark wood (dark lighting too).\n\nThe food though is just not as good.  Starting with the amuse of crostini topped with garbanzo beans.  It was perfectly fine, but it lacked the punch of the similar amuse crostini at Osteria Mozza, which features creamy and freshly made ricotta as well as fragrant and fresh basil.\n\nB&B's burrata starter was a simple preparation with cracked pepper, olive oil and good and grilled bruschetta-like toasts.  The burrata starter was fine, but it was something I would expect to find at Batali's more casual and much less pricey Pizzeria Mozza than a supposedly high-end spot like B&B.  Osteria, on the other hand, showcases much more creative burrata dishes with great flavor combinations and ingredients.\n\nB&B's octopus was garnished with a mix of Italian white beans and a limoncello vinaigrette.  The octopus was big yet soft and the overall flavor was good though I think the octopus at Osteria Mozza is much more focused and thus more intense and distinct.\n\nThe beef cheek ravioli with black truffles and crushed duck liver is a popular pasta option here, but I found it very underwhelming.  While the flavor was fine, the truffle flavor was not there.  The pasta itself was okay, but the beef cheek filling was very puree like.  I would have preferred a more braised beef-like filling.\n\nThe crispy sweetbreads entree was served atop a butternut squash puree and with a side of frisee salad garnished with crisp apples.  The frisee salad was fine, but the sweetbreads had a very unattractive color.  They looked like karaage not fried at a high enough temperature.  There was not much crispiness on the exterior (not much flavor either).  The inside was okay (not too fatty), but it lacked the hot and juicy center of really nicely prepared sweetbreads.\n\nFor dessert, the warm chocolate torta was the all-too-common chocolate molten lava cake, but it was still satisfying with a good cake-like exterior and a rich and warm chocolate center (it came with olive oil gelato).  The tiramisu was kind of like a modern take on tiramisu with a cake topped with mascarpone cream and then garnished with a chocolate sauce and an espresso gelato.  It was an okay dessert, but it lacked the great strong flavor of tiramisu.\n\nThe apple crostata with vanilla bean gelato was not good.  The apples were not that caramelized and the pastry was a little greasy.  It was too soft--not crispy enough like a great crostata or puff pastry.\n\nService was okay--pleasant enough but ordering and getting the bill took too long.  Service was just not as attentive as it should have been.\n\nAs mentioned, B&B features a mostly dark interior so it does not have that memorable of a look.  The restaurant gets loud.\n\nPrices are very high, but that is to be expected given that the restaurant comes from Batali and it is in Vegas.  The pasta tasting menu seems like an okay value if all of the pasta courses are satisfying.\n\nB&B Ristorante is, unfortunately, a lot like many of the other upscale Las Vegas restaurants--it feels the part and comes from a big name, but the food is simply too expensive and nowhere near the same standard of similar restaurants in cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York.\n\nThe Palazzo / Venetian, like all the other major hotels and casinos on The Strip, offers complimentary self and valet parking.", "business_id": "rNahhyqDlouyDMHh57p3ug", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-01-23", "type": "review"}

Sandwich was a good value with tons of ham- a bit salty for my liking but like I said, good value. Soup was very tasty and smooth, with good flavor. Added a side of onion rings, which was about ten rings for $3- perfectly crisp in beer batter, did not fall apart while eating.\n\nMy guy had the 10 piece hot wings with a cup of chili- wings were not hot but had good flavor and were a large size, priced well at $10 for the order coming out to a dollar a wing. Would come back for these wings despite lack of heat, wish they offered more sauces. Chili was also good quality- meaty with a few kidney beans, topped with green onions and cheese.

Which is probably the furthest you could get to the whole Vegas night club status. \n\nInstead of bottle service tables... well, they still have the table service. Only you have two giant television screens with your game going as they push the table service like drinks at you. I guess that's cool and all, but couldn't you just be a baller at home with your console system and a case of beer for much cheaper? \n\nThe other side of the place is all old arcades. And if they aren't old, they're clearly run the fuck down. Straight up wondering if they got new arcade rom kits and just put them in old cabinets to save on space. The end result is that the place looks like a depressing old arcade with run down machines in one corner and then the latest generation of consoles on the screens over the bar. \n\nNow if you're a bar, you need to bring it when it comes to the drink department. Some of those drinks were weak sauce and the attempt to make them named after video game references fell flat when the drink wasn't very thematic after all. You can't just call a vodka drink some Zelda shit if it doesn't have something that ties it to it.\n\nI got the kirby drink and was surprised to see it came out in a martini glass and really pink.

It was pulling in so many different directions in trying to be a club like atmosphere to get folks on the dance floor. Better choice would have been something electronic to tie into the whole fact that this is a barcade. \n\nAlso the old machines were 50 cents a pop even if the shit looked like it has spent its life abused in a chuck e cheese. \n\nI'm not saying give me that straight up baller Dave and Busters experience, yo.

Served by Scott as trendy tunes floated overhead amidst a deluge of chandeliers it was to great coffee and friendly service that we were greeted just after the restaurant's 7am opening and seated close to the bar the it was with a simple request that courses were paced out in decadent progression, none less than good and a few truly exemplary over the course of an hour with coffee never less than half-full.  Beginning with a single savory before for moving to sweets, homemade biscuits would prove fluffy yet well-buttered beneath thick spiced gravy and although perhaps an odd pairing with a slice of \"The Best\" carrot cake, I actually preferred the biscuits as the cake itself was excellent while the frosting was just a bit too sweet.  Moving next to a far better use of the carrot cake batter, cast-iron skilled pancakes with light cream cheese drizzle would prove light and every bit on par with those at MTO Caf\u00e9 while the similarly topped Red Velvet stack would prove the best I've had to date with light cocoa tones filling the a fluffy batter bronzed by the griddle.

Located inside the SLS, under the gleaming guise of the Greek Pharaoh and Starck designed through-and-through, our 6:30 seating started with pleasant greetings at the podium and quickly swept away to a small two-top flanking an open kitchen the service could not have been better, drinks kept brimming throughout the evening and plates arriving in a slow, measured fashion - exactly as requested.  Beset by tagines and spice jars juxtaposing slick surfaces and sparkling chandeliers beneath a lively soundtrack that only rarely interrupted conversation our meal began with a quartet of $7 'mezzes' and with both spreads silky smooth and teaming with flavor atop pillows of Laffa the Kibbeh and creamy spinach puffs were no less special, the former balancing ground lamb to nuts and spice beneath a golden shell.  Moving next to larger plates under simplified headings like \"Vegetables\" and \"Meats\" it was with some disappointment that we were informed the coveted Duck Bastilla was unavailable but making due with four more items both the elegantly paired mushrooms and equally well conceived tagine were quite good while the still-bubbling moussakah was my favorite plate of the night.  A touch underwhelmed by crispy balls of falafel that had trouble standing up to the sauce in which they sat it was in flatbread that our savories finished and with a crisp, charred crust from the central oven likely to make any topping taste better the bitter kale amidst pools of tangy cr\u00e8me fraiche was wonderful, an elegant and light dish I could see playing well to the pre-club crowd heading to LiFE.  At this point approaching nine o'clock, with every seat in the space filled, our meal concluded with coffee alongside a duo of desserts and as much I liked the somewhat out-of-place pudding it was the pannacotta that stole the show - each creamy bite flooding the palate with milky-sweet tones while Amareto soaking the figs lingered at the end.\n\nAlthough higher priced than the typical 'mom n' pop' or Greek festival setting, almost every single item we tasted at Cleo was reference standard, the total bill with tax and tip clocking in just under $160 for nearly three hours of great food, service, and 'scene.'  Certainly not a place for quiet conversation but definitely a spot where both the 'club' crowd or the local looking for a nice night out can be equally comfortable I commend the team at Cleo for bringing something totally new to the scene - it is original concepts like this and Yusho that The Strip really needs.", "business_id": "XqpUYK7tjHe_gi0BrNf1sw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-09-28", "type": "review"}

A small store but with a well culled selection of local cheeses and butters, immaculate organic vegetables and various salads, plus proteins like Jidori Chicken and Berkshire Pork from Tender Belly Farms I'll definitely have to make a return shopping visit in the future.\n\nMoving on to the items I selected, beginning first with the donut I have to say I expected better - sure the brioche was buttery and surprisingly light, but perhaps due to the time of day or maybe because the donuts were stored on an air-exposed rack the overall consistency was simply too dry.  Nicely flavored with what seemed to be vanilla tinged cinnamon sugar perhaps I just got a bad selection, particularly as the hole was much better.  Waiting for a while to tackle the brownie (after lunch, to be exact,) it would prove to be far more successful than the donut and having the option to select a corner piece I was particularly impressed by the heft of the cocoa notes and how the use of fruit helped to sweeten the brownie without making it overly sweet.  Clearly the result of quality ingredients and rustic as can be I will say that if you can resist temptation long enough to get it home a quick second in the microwave to enjoy it warm really helps as the melting pockets of chocolate juxtaposed against date, nut, and cake were lovely.", "business_id": "3yNs4HBBk7kIDFBa3G9BrA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-09-09", "type": "review"}

Open at 8am and myself the first to arrive just as the doors were unlocked it was to a bright room of psychedelic colors and paraphernalia that I was welcomed by a young woman named Misty and invited to sit anywhere I opted for a two-top with mismatched chairs at the room's center - the open kitchen to my left, a window to my right, Jimi Hendrix IN the table plus a deck of 'Go-Fish' and an enormous menu on it - the latter quickly navigated to the tune of an appetizer and a main plus a side with each scratch-made item prepped to order as I sat listening to The Beatles. Monkeys, and Dylan.

Setting aside a thin and boring biscuit improved somewhat by honey, my request with the sandwich in place of four styles of potatoes, and moving right on to dessert it was admittedly a great showing of restraint that prevented me from ordering the \"PB+B for two\" but with lemon cake and \"awesome\" brownies as the alternatives my choice became simple - the nearly 1/3 pound chocolate-on-chocolate wedge so moist it seemed only semi-solid and so rich that even half the $3 serving would suffice many brownie lovers...so long as the other half is enjoyed with an iced double espresso a few hours later.", "business_id": "jqMWeYMVeqnvHNeMd772Ew", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-02-23", "type": "review"}

In the summertime, you can get under $100, even on weekends (if there isn't a big show, which there usually isn't in the dead of summer). The reason this is a good thing, is if you come to Las Vegas for business like I do, the last thing I want to do is have to walk 20 minutes through a huge casino and another 20 minutes around a huge parking lot just to get to my car. That's worse if you are lugging stuff each way. Here, you just step outside and there is your car.  \n\nNow if you are just coming to Vegas for your once a year get drunk and wild party, then maybe this isn't for you. On the other hand, if you are staying for a few days and want to save some money for the casinos or shows, this is a good choice. It has free hot breakfast and free happy hour during the week, like all Embassy Suites. There is also free WiFi in you suite and throughout the Atrium..\n\nThe hotel itself is a little hard to get to off Paradise, but is nicely kept, with 12 stories, a great atrium, the signature glass elevators and greenery, a mezzanine third floor lounge, indoor pool and outdoor jacuzzi. The rooms are 2 room suites with vanity and armoir in the bedroom with 2 doubles or a king, and the front room has a sofabed, lounge chair, table for 4, wetbar, microwave, and minifridge.The decor is simple elegance in contemporary colors, with marble tiling in the bathroom and minibar. \n\nThe lobby fountain is a soothing interplay of water jets, programmed in playful arrays, like a mini Bellagio fountain show. \n\nIf you want more money to spend on food, shows, and gambling, don't want to walk into a smokey casino every time you want to go to your car half a mile a way or take a dip in the pool, and don't mind getting free breakfast and happy hour and quick in and out to your car without walking or waiting for 20 minutes, stay here, particularly if you have a trade show to attend at the convention center, or you are on a sensible budget and been to Vegas many times before.", "business_id": "elGcsECAy3QNE5OLWdOuKA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-07-10", "type": "review"}

The brainchild of Duc Liao and his wife Noelle based on their time in Paris as a photographer and model, respectively, the space had originally appeared on my radar based on the recommendation of a friend and had only increased its status in my mind by advertising one of my favorite desserts - the Paris Brest - on their website.\n\nLocated in a rather unattractive strip-mall beside a Subway my arrival to Scratch would be just past noon and with the thermostat topping the century mark I made my way quickly from the car to the cute French-Chic interior and greeted by two young ladies behind the counter I was asked if I planned to dine in or take some items to go, a decision I debated for a few seconds before I was handed a menu and left to decide.  Already with lunch plans I knew the bistro menu was not the choice (though admittedly the duck and foie gras had my attention) and as such I turned my attention to the pastry case only to be told that no Paris Brest was available - a disappointment to be sure, but at the same time given the variety of options (including a number of my other favorites) not totally disheartening and after a few moments of indecision I opted for three selections, paid the modest tab, and made my way outside to enjoy.\n\nBeginning first with the only warm item of the group, an almond croissant fresh from the oven, my first bite from Scratch would show that the Liao's time in Paris had been well spent as the golden shell shattered on my bite giving way to an airy layered interior with a smear of sweet frangipane that not only added flavor and nuance to the already sweet pastry but also did not weigh down the wispy pastry inside; a fine balance not often seen in American Almond Croissants.\n\nMoving next to another French specialty, a small Salted Caramel Macaron stored refrigerated in a plastic sheath, this two bite $3 cookie would prove rather average largely due to the temperature and a degree of dampness marring its characteristic crackling shell.  With the filling ample in flavor I do wonder if perhaps the dry Arizona air has something to do with the decision to store these cookies chilled, but overall it is not a decision I fancied when it came down to texture.\n\nFor my final taste of Scratch I opted for an American classic, my typical Red Velvet cupcake, and where the macaron disappointed the cupcake achieved at the highest level; a textural masterpiece ranking in my top 3 red velvet cupcakes of all time.  Beginning first with the frosting, seemingly a small puff of sour cream cheese actually tunneling down into the body of the cake, it was quite good but where this cake truly stood out was its density - the sort of moist sponginess that made the cake seem almost undercooked as a bit of red dripped onto my hand, but in reality a veritable cloud of loaded with chocolate and vanilla tones that permeated the palate in perfect balance with the frosting.  \n\nOverall Scratch was a good visit and I feel like I (pun intended) merely scratched the surface of what they have to offer - if and when I return I'm calling ahead to make sure they have the Brest and while I'm there I'll check out that bistro menu because, really, where else can you get duck and foie gras for lunch in town and chase it with a top notch French Pastry or cupcake?", "business_id": "tZXPhvufHhfejGrRp554Lg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-13", "type": "review"}

Not particularly a fan of Fieri but having found some of his recommendations to at least be interesting (and in the case of Rino's Place occasionally outstanding) the restaurant fit my time frame as well as location and as such I decided to give it a go.\n\nArriving shortly after the doors opened at 6:30 Over Easy Caf\u00e9 was easily located via GPS and attached to the Phoenix Coyotes Ice Den practice facility I allocated parking quickly and after a quick browse of the rink I made my way into the caf\u00e9 - a starkly decorated seemingly converted office space with a breakfast bar and Formica all around and with a few tables of patrons already seated I was greeted at the door with the suggestion to sit anywhere I like.  In this case electing for a two-top near the doors I took my seat where silverware wrapped in napkins along with the menu were already in place and grabbing a copy of the local paper I started to peruse the menu moments before service would arrive, a pleasant young lady named Samantha who appeared to be the only server working the room.\n\nClearly a place for regulars as nearly ever patron to enter after me was greeted by name Samantha welcomed me and filling my water asked if I'd like coffee while I perused the menu; an offer I gladly agreed to when I noted that they were serving the same locally roasted Caf\u00e9 Cortez as the day prior at Morning Glory.  \n\nWith my coffee being readied and having already perused the online menu I would be ready to order by the time Samantha returned and with the time just before 7:00 I opted for two dishes, both garnering a \"good choice,\" and sat back to read the paper and listen to the overhead radio while I waited perhaps fifteen minutes for my plates to arrive.\n\nWith service efficient and friendly throughout my stay and coffee maintained near full along with my water my two plates would arrive simultaneously and having heard some (Food Network) call Over Easy the best breakfast in the state while the posters on the walls hailed Fieri's commentary I started first with their signature item of Waffle Dogs, three chorizo spiced pork breakfast sausages on sticks dipped in the house waffle batter and fried to a golden brown and dusted with powdered sugar.  Warned that these were hot in temperature but mild in flavor Samantha suggested a combination of maple syrup (not authentic maple, mind you) and hot sauce as a condiment for this and first tasting the Dogs themselves and then with syrup and sauce I had to admit they were better dressed but not terribly impressive either way.  A bit spicy and a nice blend of sweet and savory the overall impression was that yes, this was kind of like a corndog, but without the cornbread and thus inferior.  Light and without oiliness the crispness was appreciated, but overall rather lacking for a \"signature\" dish.\n\nMoving next to my second selection, the better of the two by some degree, a half order of Caramelized banana & pecan French toast was delivered - a dish that would clearly be tasty based simply on ingredients, but actually a nice preparation with the single slice of buttery brioche crisp on the exterior and custard like on the inside topped with fresh bananas, crunchy pecans, and a thick caramel sauce that tasted good on the toast and equally delicious spooned into my coffee.  Certainly not a breakfast for those lacking a sweet tooth one slice was definitely enough, especially after the waffle dogs.\n\nWith a coffee offered for the road and the clock just shy of 7:45 I accepted the to-go cup and after paying the admittedly modest tab plus tip made my way from the restaurant en route to clinic along with the newspaper housing and sports sections that I was encouraged to take along with me.   Overall a nice place with good service I cannot say I'd go out of my way for Over Easy, but considering its location I could certainly see it making a great breakfast spot after a morning skate - goodness knows it would have trumped the Denny's or Bob Evans I frequented after hockey as a lad.", "business_id": "Cz0McL5lUaihqOIw0_Yo7w", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-10-12", "type": "review"}

For me, it was almost always breakfast.\n\nTruth be told, neither the food nor the establishment is all that exciting.

At least with most of the breakfast options, they're likely to be fresher at least with eggs and hashbrowns + breakfast meat.\n\nIt was easy to order a simple platter consisting of scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, and hash browns.

Sure all of the modern hoorahrah is great, but that place has history and at Alan Albert's you still feel a bit of it.\n\nThe waiters are dressed as steakhouse waiters should be, in nice white jackets and know their meats. They also have great sense of humors, since I imagine living in Vegas you'd have to. On one of my trips here last year. we got an old Irish man who rapped us the specials since clearly we exuded the 50-cent vibe, what? Yeah, it was random, but this is what I love about the place.\n\nThe food is awesome. Steaks are of course their signature dish, but the seafood fare is fantastic as well. Lobstas baby! And if you go, ask if they have the lobster bisque. Sometime they do, sometimes they don't, but G-D Damn is that some good stuff! Use the bread to clean the plate, mmmm mmmmm! Also, like any old school steakhouse, the sides are a la carte, so make sure to try the creamed spinach(if this spinach thing ever let's up) and definitely get the asparagus as their hollandaise sauce kicks the ass!\n\nWine list is also pretty good, but the martoonis are fantastic and they know how to do a dirrty one without tasting like you are stuck in an over-saturated \"olive\" garden.\n\nSo go check it out. Not cheap, but definitely a nice meal in a cool place with great service and no one will say \"You're money\" here. Also, it is kind of hidden. If you are taking a cab, the cab driver should know, but just know that it is on Las Vegas Blvd but kind of towards the back between two buildings.

I have no such qualms. Of course, you've got to take that with a grain of salt (get it?!!) since I've only been to a few places, but Salt is easily my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant to date.\n\nWhile the communal tables were packed and lively on a Friday evening, we were able to sit down at the bar immediately. I would've preferred a spot watching the open kitchen, but I'll never be sad about sitting at a bar, especially one manned by such talented ladies. Both of us jumped on the bourbon cocktail of the day; with Green Chartreuse and hickory, it was a bit on the sweet side for him, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nThe menu on the wall (and only on the wall, no printed copies anywhere) was appealing from top to bottom, and we went meat-heavy with our orders. We started with the steak tartare; a bit of bone marrow, cornichons and a silky quail egg punched up the quality cut, and it was flawless. \n\nHowever, it still paled in comparison to the crispy gnocchi, served with chunks of astonishingly tender beef cheek, all atop an unctuous layer of beef tongue. The light touch of a papaya sauce, along with a bit of the braising liquid, culminated in nothing less than culinary genius. I loved every bite, and if he wasn't my brother, I probably would've broken his face for eating almost half. \n\nSince three types of beef weren't enough for him, he also opted for the hanger steak as his main. Served with broccoli kimchi and a wild rice porridge, the beef was once again a winner. The dish was a bit soupier than anticipated, but the dark porridge was a perfect vehicle for the medium rare meat, once again tender as can be. \n\nI chose the duck. The perfectly cooked slices of breast were laid over a parsnip puree and accompanied by halusky with onion and apple, a few roasted brussel sprouts and what appeared to be even more braised duck. While it might not be an affordable entree by Pittsburgh standards, you absolutely get your money's worth with each order here. It was a MEAL, and a damn fine one.\n\nThroughout dinner, the service was excellent. Our beautiful bartenders were kind enough to keep us in cocktails (a Manhattan for me, complete with a huge, round ice cube) after we finished our initial offerings, and didn't rat me out for stealing huge pieces of steak while my brother was in the bathroom.\n\nIf I had a complaint, it would be that it's gonna be a bitch to hit up the 'Burgh every time I want to eat here, but I'll be back.", "business_id": "p1Wb4mEH04qrUMfmPepFzw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-26", "type": "review"}

I believe the Beverly Hills location is just open for lunch and dinner so it made sense to give this Vegas spot a try for a nice brunch.\n\nBouchon is located on the tenth floor of the hotel.  They seem to have three dining areas--a classic indoor brasserie, outdoor dining and a private room for private parties and larger groups (which is where we dined on this visit).  I haven't been to their outdoor dining area, but the private room lacks the classic French brasserie feel of the main dining area.  The tables though are still nice (white table cloth) and the seating is comfortable.\n\nFor brunch, they started us off with a complimentary epi baguette that was served with butter and a smooth/thick cherry jam.  The epi baguette (a wheat stalk shaped bread where you rip off individual baguettes) was good.  The bread's crust was good and distinct while the center had a good chew to it.  The butter spread easily and the jam was flavorful.\n\nI went with their signature roasted chicken and bacon and chive waffles.  The roasted chicken was very good.  It was a half chicken.  The breast was tender and moist.  The skin had a great flavor and was nicely crispy.  The thigh and leg had much more flavorful meat as well as crispy skin (not too greasy or fatty either).\n\nThey served the chicken with a Sauce Chasseur.  The chicken was very flavorful and did not need it, but the sauce was a great accompaniment.  The sauce was similar to a brown gravy and was very flavorful.  The sauce had a good white wine taste to it and there were chunks of good veggies in it including mushrooms, carrots and onions.\n\nThe bacon and chive waffle was fluffy.  It was an interesting flavor combination.  First, you taste the vanilla (they used a good amount of it in the waffle).  Then you get the crispy and savory bacon taste.  Then you get the onion-like chive taste.  The waffle was garnished with a creamy Tahitian vanilla butter and maple syrup.  I am not sure if the flavor combination would be for everyone, but I liked the waffle.\n\nI also had some of the bacon a la carte and it was pretty good.  Flavorful and crisp though maybe not as good as some of the premium bacon out there (like the Niman Ranch bacon they serve at Huckleberry).\n\nService was good.  The waiter was friendly, polite and attentive.  The rest of the staff was attentive too.  Food came out an okay pace (maybe slightly slower than we would have liked).  Still, despite being a large party, all the food came out at about the same time.\n\nFor brunch, pricing was high here, but then pricing is high at a lot of Vegas restaurants.  Entrees run anywhere from about $15 to $25 here.  The good thing is that portions on most of the dishes are big enough that you do not have to supplement your order with any sides or pastries (they were providing a complimentary coffee cake-like dish in the waiting area and it was good).\n\nThis was my second visit to the Las Vegas Bouchon.  I've also been to the Beverly Hills one.  The roasted chicken and waffles was the best thing I've had here at either location and I would most likely come back here again for brunch if I was in Vegas for the weekend.  Service and food have been decent enough on both visits that I would also consider them for dinner.\n\nThere is a free parking structure at The Venetian.

Since then, there have been many new hotels that have joined The Strip and some as elegant or even more elegant than Bellagio.\n\nBellagio definitely has a beautiful exterior with the impressive and vast lake as well as the signature fountains.  Inside, you will find the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens--a constantly changing (with the seasons) exhibit that makes for a good photo opportunity.  Bellagio also features quite a few notable fine dining spots including Picasso, Le Cirque and Michael Mina.  There is also a gourmet French patisserie (Jean Philippe) though all of these great things are open to the public and do not require a room stay, which is expensive though often less expensive than The Cosmopolitan, Wynn or Encore.\n\nMy room was nice.  It was fairly contemporary though there were a lot of traditional touches with the bedding and furniture.  The room did lack the sleek and modern look of the rooms at Aria.\n\nThe bathroom was nice--very spacious with standalone showers and bath tubs.  There were a few areas where the room could have been better.  The TV was an old fashioned deep TV and not a flat screen.  I often never turn on a hotel room TV though I imagine some would be disappointed to find such an outdated TV in an upscale hotel like Bellagio.\n\nThe other negative, which was a big one, was the room temperature.  The A/C unit was not that good and even after having maintenance look at it, the room just never got cool enough, which can be a concern here due to the very hot summers.  It seems other Yelp reviews indicate the same issue regarding poor A/C units.  However, I believe Bellagio has been refreshing the decor in their rooms so maybe these outdated elements and poor A/C units have been (or will be) improved (I think they have moved onto flat screen TVs).\n\nAlso included in the stay was access to the fitness center, which was nice.  The pool area was also nice--many different pools and lots of greens, fountains and other scenery if you are just looking to lounge around.\n\nService was friendly and prompt.\n\nRoom rates are high at Bellagio, but there are times of the year where you can find reasonable room rates.  Bellagio has a room rate calendar on their website, which makes for a useful tool to help you pick a time to stay at Bellagio (best room rates are often during the week though and several top Vegas shows are dark and high end restaurants are closed in the early part of the week).\n\nI wished I liked my room more at Bellagio.  I actually liked Caesars Palace more.  I have heard the quality of the room really varies at which tower you stay at Caesars Palace, but the room I had there felt nicer, more elegant and more comfortable than Bellagio.  And even though my first stay at Aria was at a very small room, my second stay there was at a much bigger room and its modern and sleek look felt more upscale than Bellagio.\n\nIf you can get a good room rate at Bellagio though, it can be a good hotel choice on The Strip.  It is still a nice hotel and it has a great location--right next to Caesars Palace and The Cosmopolitan, which is a real hot spot right now.  Even if you do not stay at Bellagio, it is a must visit for first time Las Vegas travelers to check out the Fountains of Bellagio, the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens and some of their food (either a more cost friendly option like Jean Philippe or one of their upscale restaurants like the good-for-Vegas Picasso).\n\nLike most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Bellagio offers both free valet and self parking.", "business_id": "-7yF42k0CcJhtPw51oaOqQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-01-08", "type": "review"}

You can sit at a bar or slot machine and have an awesome view of the street level of the Strip.  I bet this will be a great spot on NYE!\n\n- I love the design and decor of the property (see pics).  Chandeliers, various designs in different areas of the casino floor are very impressive.  The artwork here is great too and all over the place.....you have to see it for yourself!\n\n- Jason the Jeweler (designer of the Lakers' 2010 Championship Ring) has a store here.\n\n- Although we didn't eat here, the food options look great.  We want to come back and try Holsteins & STK.\n\n- The employees are very friendly and have a great attitude.  I know they just opened and you should expect that, but believe me it's hard to find that attitude here in Vegas.\n\n- Parking was easy.  The self-parking garage is underground and has the meters that show you how many spaces are available on each level, bonus.\n\n- The bars & lounges here are very cool.  We had drinks at Bond and the Chandelier Lounge.  Both places were comfortable and provided great people watching seats.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed the place and have a bunch of places we want to come back and try out.  I hope they make it in this economy.\n\nWill I return?  Are you crazy?  Of course I will!", "business_id": "AtjsjFzalWqJ7S9DUFQ4bw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-12-31", "type": "review"}

Upon seeing the prices/selection, I almost left to try the buffet instead, figuring I'd spend about the same amount, but I'm bad with portion control and figured the quality would probably be less, so I stayed.\n\nIt wasn't particularly busy, and despite the name and decor had a distinctly diner-esque feel to it, for some reason. They had a seafood special going on, so I opted for the $7 ceviche appetizer and was decently surprised at the portion- though more tortilla chips could have been served with it. Glass contained about 2 cups, mixed shrimp and scallops, and was alright. It would have been more appropriate served with lime slices rather than lemon, but the taste wasn't bad and the fish was clearly fresh. I know it's all about presentation, but eating the ceviche out of a wine glass and attempting to spoon it onto tortilla chips is a clumsy affair and would have been better suited to a lower stemmed bowl of some sort. \nNot sure why I ordered the chicken burrito for my entree- I can have Mexican food at home, right? But I was in a cheese-craving mood and didn't like the idea of spending $10 on a plate of nachos (though maybe that would have been a better choice), so I went with the overpriced burrito plate. At the very least it is a large quantity of food. Beans were slightly off and rice was overly wet and bland, and the burrito itself, while large and stuffed with chicken, wasn't particularly flavorful. Used up a lot of the pico, salsa, sour cream, and guac just trying to eat about half of it without simply choking down shredded chicken. \n\nIn any case, the staff were very polite though not very present/available. In my case, that was a good thing, because I was lingering there for just over an hour with my food and a glass of wine, waiting for my friend to arrive as our rooms were in his name. That being said, it was bizarre to have so many other servers come by so frequently but never see my own- and never have anyone offer to fill my water glass.

Somehow I had it in my head that the Wild Wild West was the hidden gem of Vegas buffets. Well, when Jamie W. and I drove there, we discovered that it was a tired motel filled with frog-voiced smokers next to a Denny's. Surely my mind was playing tricks on me. As I realized much later, it was Sam's Town I was looking for, but regardless, we were jonesing for breakfast. Thanks to the trusty Yelp app on my iPhone, we zeroed in on WaffleS Cafe. \n\nSurprise, surprise...it's in a strip mall just like almost every non-Strip eatery in town. It really looks like a smoothie shop since I couldn't tell if they even had a kitchen. The overhead menu would have you believe it's a virtual waffle-palooza in there. Perhaps but I didn't hear the sound of a griddle or the plop of the batter, which made me think the waffles are made elsewhere and heated up in the back. It was just too quiet in there. Anyhow, both of us went for the $5.49 Breakfast Special - which consisted of a large, round waffle; a couple of eggs; bacon or sausage; and a cup of coffee. \n\nI ordered the pumpkin waffle and had blueberries and whipped cream placed on top. It was good, and the meaty sausage and scrambled eggs helped a lot. Jamie showed greater forbearance and had his pumpkin waffle plain with a pat of butter, but he weakened and went for the bacon. All in all, it didn't feel substantive enough to be the breakfast we desired, but it did tie us over until the dogs we had at Pink's for lunch. Not because of the server, who was quite nice and cheery, but I doubt if I'll be back simply because it is slipping from my memory as I write this. \n\nFOOD - 3 stars...nice large Belgian-style waffles but the oomph factor seemed missing \nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...surely they sell Jamba Juice here, don't they? \nSERVICE - 4 stars...peppy and responsive \nTOTAL - 3 stars...just not quite memorable enough for me to return for a waffle", "business_id": "7h0-KtLbYH1gu6QBv_-jxg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-01-25", "type": "review"}

Tacos are $1.25-$1.50 each, my two-taco take-out order was basically $3. But when I opened the bag at home, there was a foil packet roughly the size of a slice of cheese. I wondered how they could have given me the wrong order, given that I was one of only two orders at the time.\n\nTHE REALITY: My two tacos were both mini-tacos, and the condiment container of grilled onions I'd grabbed at the salsa bar seemed to dwarf the actual tacos. I know street tacos are on corn tortillas and run a smidge smaller at traditional places than, say, Taco Bell or Del Taco, but these were absurdly small.\nSimilarly-priced tacos at Tacos Gil or the guys on Decatur are all easily twice the size of what I received here. Key words: similarly-priced. \n\nThat being said, the lengua taco is fairly good and I liked the mild salsa verde, but the asada was lacking and overpowered by the ranchero-style sauce included when you ask for \"everything on it\". \n\nTHE VERDICT: Disappointing. For tacos, anyway. Maybe I'll go Jade's route and try the soup next time.\n\nSide note: also watch out for the guy in the parking lot with a bottle of Windex.

The Red Beans & Rice was not like what I was hoping for (New Orleans Style)....this one was very dry and had a ton of Tomatoes in it....the RBR I've had in New Orleans is much more wet and I don't recall this much Tomato in it.  The best side was the Slaw & Baked Beans....those were actually very good and our favorite out of the 4 sides.

With the bar empty and only one section being seated be claimed our reservation and were led quickly to a table near the large glass windows - an excellent view of the river would be our companion throughout the meal.  Meeting our waiter, a friendly man named Chendo we were given menus and a brief explanation of the daily special pastas for the Pasta Trio.  With the restaurant quite slow that day I will note we were very well taken care of throughout out meal - the service staff was excellent.\n\nBrowsing the high ceilinged room, randomly placed bottles and objects, and abundant brightly colored glass panels plus Chihuily influenced chandeliers I have to say Lidia's is a very handsome restaurant - it has that \"wow\" factor of many New York City dining rooms.  While the white paper over white tablecloth aspect of the table setting struck me as odd, everything else felt \"fine dining\" without seeming forced.\n\nSitting and waiting for our meals to arrive we were first delivered one of the better bread baskets I've had in recent memory - Sea Salt Foccacia, Rustic Italian, and Cracked Wheat Sourdough served with two spreads, a Chick Pea Pesto and pureed White Beans with Black Olive, both resting in a pool of slightly sweet extra virgin olive oil.  Served warm the breads were tantalizing and given the size of the portions soon to be arriving it was definitely a chore not to overindulge (a chore I failed, miserably.)\n\nFor our main courses my mother opted for a salad and a contorti while Erika and I chose pastas.  For myselfthe choice was quite simple - my favorite pasta and my favorite protein on the same plate, Gnocchi with Duck Guazetto.  An Italian Stew not unlike Chicken Cacciatore, but featuring duck in white wine instead of Chicken in Red the thick reduction was hearty, meaty, smoky, and laden with vegetables.  Paired with a toothsome yet non-doughy potato gnocchi the dish was not only enormous, but incredibly filling.  While I will admit I ate a lot of bread and helped my mother and sister  with their plates I can say that this was one dish I couldn't finish, it was just too large.\n\nFor Mother's selection she opted for the Roasted Beet and Apple Salad with Frisee and Fresh Goat Cheese plus the Pan Seared Golden Polenta Fritters.  A competent salad with sweet apples balancing earthy beets and pungent goat cheese the dish was brought together by a splash of balsamic and olive oil, ample in size and flavor, very nicely done.  Not fairing quite as well as the Salad were the Fritters - nicely prepared and crispy on the outside with creamy polenta within, they simply lacked flavor.\n\nErika's selection would be the signature Pasta Trio - three pastas plated tableside with unlimited refills.  Admittedly the concept sounds somewhat \"Olive Garden\" but that is before you realize two of the pastas are made in house and one is imported direct from Italy...and all the sauces are made daily in the kitchen, as well.  Served up onto a single large platter the daily selections  would be hand torn Tagliatelle and Pork Ragu, Imported Orchiette with Fennel Sausage and Thyme, and house folded Sweet Pea and Corn Ravioli with Cream Sauce.  Enormous in portion I cannot really fathom anyone requiring seconds of the trio and at a mere $14 the selections were excellent.  Smoky and Sweet the Pork Ragu complimented the al dente Tagliatelle nicely while the aromatic sausage was an equally balanced flavor for the Orchiette.  The most impressive of the group, the sweet pea and corn ravioli, was sweetened only by the vegetal components while the cream itself had notes of cinnamon and nutmeg.\n\nArriving simultaneously and thankfully smaller than the entrees was Torta di Mandorle e Mirtilli - Blueberry and almond cake, blueberry-lavender ice cream, almond crunch, blueberries. .  If a little is good a lot is better seemed to be the theme of this dessert and it worked nicely - the fresh blueberries lacing the buttery pound cake, the flowery accent to the blueberry ice cream, and the crunchy sugared almonds paired with even more blueberries - excellent.\n\nThe second dessert, larger in size but lighter in texture, would be Panna Cotta alla Fragola - Strawberry and ricotta panna cottas, lemon-strawberry sandwich cookies, fresh strawberries.  Served in a 12oz glass better suited for a milkshake the panna cotta was surprisingly springy and well blended with a more gelatin strawberry base topped by an ample creamy layer of whipped cream and ricotta.  Unnecessary but welcomed the lemony cookies were much akin to a shortbread in texture and Madeline in flavor.\n\nHaving heard \"upscale Olive Garden\" comparisons I personally find that assessment far from accurate and would actually go so far as to say that aside from the lack of seasoning the the experience was on par with many fine dining Italian establishments in other cities.", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-04", "type": "review"}

Recently visited Goodwich and Art of Flavors in the same plaza, and knew it wouldn't be long til I'd be downing arepas, too...\n\nScouted out the menu online, cross referencing it with reviews here, and ultimately decided on the #1: shredded beef and the #7: reina pepiada, plus a side of fried yucca. Total came to just over $15, which was a bit pricey IMO.\n\nThe arepas were unique and tasty, but fell a little short of my expectations. The shredded beef was a little on the dry side, but I perked it up with a bunch of the creamy cilantro sauce- that stuff is the bomb dot com. The reina pepiada arepa was tasty too, but the flavor simply got boring after a few bites. \nLuckily, the yucca was there to save the day: crispy and chewy and garlicky, it's everything yucca is supposed to be! The $3 price tag was a bit steep for the 12 bits that I got, most of which were half-pieces. Would I get them again though? Resounding yes.\n\nService was okay: minimal but friendly, brought out my take out to me at a table and took my order efficiently. Decor in the restaurant is fairly typical for a taqueria, but with the added touch of local artwork on the right hand wall as you walk in, all available for purchase. Though the pieces were good and added to the ambiance of the restaurant itself, I'm again taken by the sticker shock- the two paintings closest to me were $110 and $380. For folks advertising inside of a restaurant, that seems a bit unrealistic, but what do I know.\n\nMight come back and try a few different flavors, seems like the BF and I could share three- they look deceptively small but they're very filling.

Don't believe the hype.\n\nBF is a huge prime rib fan, and when I stumbled across this place i thought I'd struck gold and found a Monday night that fit our schedules to bring him in for a surprise date night. And my carefully-laid plans bombed.\n\nPlaced his order for the prime rib special with mashed potatoes, bummed to hear it does not come with a vegetable despite many mentions in other reviews and pictures here of a veggie side. Waitress told us a side would set us back $2- for bar veggies? No thanks. My order was for the 10oz NY, which did come with a veggie, mashed potatoes as a side as well. Both of us added on a side salad for $1 extra, with bleu cheese dressing.\n\nNow, if the first element of your meal is a side salad, and you are unable to finish it, that's probably a bad sign. The salad itself was fine and decently fresh but the dressing had seen better days- it neither smelled nor tasted like and bleu cheese dressing I've ever had in my life, and we couldn't put our finger on whether it was supposed to be a yogurt-based ranch dressing, or if it was spoiled.\nWaitress cleared our still-full salad bowls in confusion, and when we mentioned that the dressing was off/funky, all she had to say was, \"Well it came straight from the bottle.\" Um, then maybe check the expiration date on that bottle.\n\nThen our entrees were brought out. BF's rare prime rib was medium rare only in the middle, and easily 1/3rd of it was fat while another 1/3rd of it appeared to be brown in color and possibly spoiled.  It tasted like more of a roast than any prime rib I've ever had.\nMy steak also had a good 1/3rd of the meat consisting of fat, and not even just around the edges of the steak itself but globs of fat within the middle of the steak- very, very low quality meat. I know my expectations for bar food are low, but come on ...\n\nFor a $30 meal, we literally ate about 1/5 of his prime rib (we were put off by the rest of it), and maybe 2/3rd of my steak, plus the broccoli and potatoes. Not really the value it's advertised as.\nOn top of that, we barely made it to the car before our stomachs started hurting.\n\nTo end on a positive note, our waitress was super friendly and sweet, though I'm a little perturbed that she didn't offer a solution or even begin to address the quality issues with our meal. That being said, she's a server and not a manager or in charge of who is selected as a supplier, so she's not really the one to discuss those matters with any way. Considering we had maybe five bites of our salads, I expected them to be removed from our bill- even if it was only a measley $2.\n\nOnly redeeming factor of our meal was the beer my BF ordered- it was a JW Dundee Nut Brown Ale and it was delicious.", "business_id": "qy7DyCFqyTPDctp_H1n-Pw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-02-25", "type": "review"}

Focusing on the food it should be noted that much of what was ordered actually came to the table exceptionally well prepared and beginning with the foie gras I was immediately impressed by the quality and presentation, a single vein the only flaw in an otherwise Robuchon-quality prep featuring a caramelized medallion alongside a semi-sweet salad plus creamy, rich croquette and moving next to crispy, complex chicken alongside the equally crisp but decidedly spicy fries it was with good fortune that the milk shake, albeit small, was present to quell the heat.  Overlooking the spongy, dense bao and tepid duck entirely lacking for crisp skin and instead assisting my mother with the lightly charred burger topped with woodsy mushrooms and aromatic marmalade it was perhaps with recollections of the zeppole at Settebello the day prior that I ordered the doughnuts and although not quite as impressive, the eggy brioche stood strong beneath a dense lacquer of sugar rounding out a fairly impressive afternoon largely warranting the $75 tab, if not a significant tip.", "business_id": "t6SuvEq9PPVGzNv5bJzDtw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-12-10", "type": "review"}

Showered and refreshed by the in-room Starbucks Africa Kitamu and readied for another long day of eating, sightseeing, eating, hockey, and eating I made my way to the car and set my GPS for the town of Gilbert; destination Liberty Market, home of what many (including the local paper) have noted to be the best Bread Pudding around.\n\nA functioning grocery since 1935 and located in a building under a water tower every bit showing its age I approached Liberty Market slowly due to the local farmer's market - a market containing much of what has now been out of season in Ohio for at least a month - and with parking readily available I made my way into Liberty Market via the side door.  Passing the al fresco dining area, the kitchen, and subsequently the store and pastry counter to take my place in a line six deep I grabbed a paper menu on the way in to browse though in all reality it was not really necessary; I knew what I was there for and the pastry case had already tempted me with any number of appetizers.  \n\nStanding in line while others made their decisions, some a full meal and some merely pastries to go, when I eventually reached the coffee bar I was greeted by a young man with spacers and sleeves to fit his blas\u00e9 demeanor and placing my order the price was recited and a number was handed to me with any number of seats to choose from both inside and out.  Opting this time for the indoors and filling a glass with water and ice I took a seat with a full view of the room and placing my number on the table was left to wait for perhaps 10 minutes while reading a local guidebook detailing Liberty's history as well as  the other restaurants in Joe Johnston's stable.\n\nSipping my water while watching a small boy barely make a dent in his enormous pile of eggs my first course of the meal at Liberty would arrive hot from the pastry case in the form of the largest Cinnamon Roll I've eaten to date - a squared off yeasty pastry nearly filling the 12\" by 12\"plate and inundating what I can only imagine to be a 6 foot diameter with the smells of butter, cinnamon, and sugar.  Large yet impressively light with wispy dough sandwiching layers of cinnamon and butter and the entirely lacquered in a thin sugar shell the Cinnamon Roll wowed in flavor as much as it did in size and without being the belly buster of Cinnabon was a perfect size to share as an appetizer - or, if you're feeling truly ravenous (gluttonous) to enjoy on your own.\n\nWith the cinnamon roll easily dispatched of and now wishing I'd have gotten coffee but not wanting to withstand the 10+ deep line my second dish would arrive approximately fifteen minutes on the heels of the cinnamon roll and given all its hype I truly expected the Griddled Bread Pudding to be mind blowing, but alas it was merely very good.  Served with real maple syrup and approximately half the size and twice the weight of the cinnamon roll the bread pudding was in reality nearly flawless French Toast - a caramelized exterior and a moist custard interior, but what he had in texture it unfortunately lacked in taste.  Largely eggy but also with slight notes of cinnamon and vanilla that perked up with the syrup perhaps part of my disillusionment with the pudding was actually how sweet its predecessor had been but overall it just felt like something was missing - perhaps some fruit, whipped cream, or caramelized nuts to add a bit of texture and nuance (this is apparently how they serve the dessert, non-griddled, bread pudding.)\n\nOverall a very nice spot and a place I'd definitely return to for the baked goods as well as to try the pancakes, plus perhaps the griddled bread pudding with a side of fruit as a starter and one of those incredible looking Sticky Buns or scones as dessert.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-12", "type": "review"}

The salad was fresh and the dish was edible, but at $16...even with the localdines certificate I felt ripped off.\n\nMoving next to a pair of sweets, Aileen opted for the Parisian Crepes with Apricot preserves, Cr\u00e8me Chantilly, and Berries and requesting the dish without powdered sugar I think we both kind of chuckled at the lackluster presentation but unlike the croque this dish was at least tasty; the crepes dainty with a goodly amount of sweet filling and the cr\u00e8me light yet flavorful but at $12 probably not enough to satiate all but the slightest appetite.\n\nFor our final (and certainly most decadent) taste of Boa an order of Stuffed Pain Perdu arrived featuring two pieces of brioche wrapped around a light layer of mascarpone and Nutella that was subsequently battered and dipped in hazelnuts prior before a trip to the pan.  Nicely caramelized with an exterior still featuring a bit of crunch and an interior just short of custard plus a topping of caramelized bananas, raisins, and maple the overall flavor profile was certainly sweet but at the same time nicely balanced and certainly a step up from the rest of the morning...even if nearly twice the price and half as good as the French Toast at Essence just hours before.

I took the elevator up and checked in. The young lady at the check in desk was very nice - she promised me a nice quiet room on the 11th floor. Famous last words.\n\nThe room was clean and comfortable. I set up my MacBook Pro on the desk, jacked into ethernet, checked my e-mail and got a little work done. The room had a flat panel HD TV, dedicated HVAC unit, mini-fridge (located oddly in the bathroom area), two phones, a clock, etc. The HD TV did not appear to come with very many HD channels as far as I could tell - mostly standard def channels.\n\nI tried to fall asleep around midnight. I kept hearing loud music, laughter, yelling, and more. Finally, in desperation, at 1:15 am, I called the front desk and inquired as to what the hell was going on. I was informed that the night club next door closed at 2:00 am. I was offered ear plugs and I believe, a white noise machine.  I have my own white noise app on my iPad, I fired that up, but it was not enough to drown out the racket.\n\nI was so aggravated, that when the music stopped (at 2:15 am) and then another 15-20 minutes afterward of drunken yelling outside - that I could not get to sleep until about 4:00 am.\n\nThe next morning as I was checking out, the lady at the front desk asked me how my stay was. I was also buying a few bottles of water at that moment to take with me. I explained about the noise and that it was unacceptable, and that I would in all likelihood never stay at their hotel again.

For example, the definition of intelligence is sometimes given as the ability to learn from one's past mistakes but it is also said that the definition of stupidity is repeating the same action again and again and expecting a different outcome!\n\nWith certain honourable exceptions such as Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley, I tend to be wary of restaurants in hotels, regarding them as traps for hotel guests too lazy to leave the hotel in search of a top notch meal\n\nHowever, when I booked to watch Ka at the MGM Grand, I was intrigued by the omakase tasting menu at Shibuya, the Japanese restaurant located in their restaurant row. With a line-up of ingredients including toro, wagyu, foie gras and lobster, it looked very promising though I knew that it would take a first rate Japanese meal to satisfy me as I was also dining at another local Japanese legend in Vegas and favourite amongst Yelpers on the same trip - Raku (http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/raku-las-vegas#hrid:kQccGZ8GEw6cqZNBUqkwpQ)\n\nI made my reservation via the hotel website and the only wrinkle in the evening was that my table wasn't ready at the time I booked\n\nThe restaurant is gargantuan, a definite contrast to the intimate Raku but I did appreciate the stylish surroundungs. There was a Vegas buzz of excitement to the place and despite the size of the operation, my food arrived quickly but the meal was well paced\n\n1. Amuse of Kushi Oyster with Apple Momiji and Orange Ponzu\nI usually like my oysters freshly shucked, briney and metallic from the sea but here, the citrus notes did enhance the meaty oyster\n\n2. Trio of hamachi\nThis delicate fish was served in different preparations. Firstly as a sashimi with a hint of garlic, ginger and pepper. Then a tartar where the minced fish was mixed in with tobiko and garlic-infused ponzu. Lastly again as sashimi with wasabi, wasabi oil and Hawaiian red salt. A lovely contrast of 3 preparations\n\n3. Sashimi duo\nMy first slice of sashimi was one of my favourite fish - chu toro (fatty part of the tuna belly), served with ginger soy sauce and spiced crunchy garlic. The other piece was kanpachi, yuzu juice and black truffle oil. Yummy sashimi\n\n4. Tataki of Australian wagyu beef, lemon tamari soy, tarragon oil and garlic chips\nThe beef was almost sweet with freshness and the lemon lifted it with the nice contrast of crunchy garlic chips\n\n5. Ezi Ebi\nIf I tell you that this dish was Australian lobster tail and day boat scallops in uni sake butter sauce and that it tasted every bit as magnificent as it sounds, I think I can rest my case\n\n6. Niku\nBraised Kobe-style short rib was served with saut\u00e9ed foie gras and rounded off with sweet and spicy soy. The meat was meltingly tender and the sauce wasn't over-sweet. The umami hit from the foie gras was heavenly as usual\n\n7. Maine Lobster Miso Soup, Green Onions, Shitake Mushrooms\nNo ordinary soup as you can tell from the ingredients!\n\n8. Nigiri with freshly grated wasabi root\n\n9. Dessert Tasting\nRaspberry-Yuzu calpico pannacotta, choco-lychee mousse cake, and mochi ice cream proved a tasty, sweet and surprisingly light end to a magnificent meal\n\nAs you can tell just from reading the review (until Yelp invents smell-o-vision or taste-o-vision, I'm afraid my photos will have to do with helping me enhance my words), this was a legendary meal. Top class ingredients were treated sympahetically and allowed to sing with complementary sidekicks that enhanced and not take over. Recognisably Japanese but with a nod to western ingredients\n\nAs for restaurants in hotels, I'm very happy to eat my words provided the words are as delicious as the food at Shibuya!", "business_id": "bmNPNlCLDplWB55ic3Bixg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-05-20", "type": "review"}

Highlight courses below.\n\nI must say that the dining room at Sage is amongst the most dramatic in Vegas.  High ceilings, excellent spacing, minimalist art on the walls, plenty of dark tones and piano finish, plus ample lighting at each seat without being too bright between tables - the word \"sexy\" comes to mind immediately.  With ambient forgettable music playing overhead the location and setting does not hide the fact that you are in Vegas, but at the same time you feel miles away from a \"casino restaurant.\"  Not as secluded as Savoy, Robuchon, Twist, or Alex, but a different experience entirely - Sage feels accessible, a place where a drink and appetizers, a course or two a la carte, or a tasting menu are equally valued and nice jeans and a button down shirt look just as appropriate as the Tom Ford suit you could buy next door.\n\nBeginning the menu proper my first course would be perhaps Sage's most famous dish - the Foie Gras Creme Brulee with Blood Orange, Gran Marnier Glaze, Cocoa Nibs, and Salted Brioche.  Cracking the crisp crust and taking a bite the custard was ethereal - light yet harboring the very essence of liver with notes of egg, orange, and cocoa largely detectable on the palate more so than the tongue.  Eating slowly each bite was as good as the last and pairing the custard with the crunchy and buttery brioche was every bit on par with the best torchon I've ever had - at The French Laundry - and if possible Sage's version was even lighter and more flavorful.\n\nAlready abuzz with anticipation of what could follow such an incredible opening act my second course would prove equally competent.  Titled Yukon Gold Potato Gnocchi with Smoked Ricotta Cream Sauce, Truffle Puree, and Parsnips the pasta was absolutely flawless - pillows of potato accented air that dissolved on the tongue.  Utilizing crispy parsnips and fresh spinach for textural variation while liberally topping the plate with fresh shaved truffles and a pleasantly subtle cream sauce with hits of parsley and chive the entirety of the amalgam tasted something akin to a baked potato with the aroma of truffles.\n\nAs good as the foie gras and gnocchi were, my favorite savory of the meal would turn out to be the fourth course - Slow-poached Organic Farm Egg, Smoked Potato, Shaved Winter Truffle, Toasted Country Bread.  Always one to favor egg dishes, everything from the presentation to the flavor of this course was immaculate.  Served in a bowl at least 1 foot in diameter with a creamy foam of creme fraiche topped with shaved truffles as the only visual stimulus on arrival, the smell of the dish was that of truffle and smokiness.  Plunging my spoon deep and piercing the creamy egg I mixed slowly while enjoying the aroma before taking a bite - smooth potato gratin, creamy egg, the mild tang of the creme fraiche, and the aroma of truffle rising to the palate.\n\nMy sixth plate would prove to be another stunner - and the best duck I've yet to experience in Las Vegas.  Titled Grimaud Farms Duck, Celery Root Puree, Confit Leg, Heirloom Apples and also featuring crispy Fried Kale and Black Mission Figs the duck itself was meaty without being gamey and fatty without being overly so.  With crispy skin the three one ounce slices of duck were perched atop an unctuous and salty confit of leg while the plate was topped with a reduction of fig and balsamic.  Sitting at the base of the plate, a pave of celery root topped with apples and figs - bitter and sweet, multi-textured, and seamlessly melding with the duck forms above.\n\nWarm Brioche Bread Pudding with Roasted Pecans, Myer's Rum Sauce, and Brown Butter Ice Cream was absolutely the best non-chocolate bread pudding I've ever tasted.  Soaked through yet delicately crisp on the exterior the buttery brioche was spongy without being wet or heavy.  Topped with a thick and boozy sauce and then with a quenelle of rich and buttery ice cream the dish found contrast in temperature while crunchy pecans proved a crunchy foil to the otherwise soft and intensely sweet dish.\n\nThe first dinner in a truly over-the-top week of eating, I still look back fondly on my experience at Sage.  Call it Midwestern sensibility if you like, but there is simply something to be said for the elegant yet accessible nature of what McClain and team are doing at Sage - the space, service, and prices are nothing like the top tier of Vegas dining - but the experience and food every bit as impressive.", "business_id": "OiCxoAIoBvEWxf7p1qVVmA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-12-28", "type": "review"}

Arriving after a short wait and in an ample portion the dish consisted of a cool broth with a warm poached egg paired with a creamy Uni tongue and given a myriad of flavors and textures from a \"soup\" of snappy mountain yams, earthy hon-shimeji mushrooms, salty salmon roe, and pungent green onions.  Breaking the egg and stirring the broth it thickened quickly giving the whole dish a mellow and creamy texture that paired beautifully with the fresh uni and other ingredients - at $7 this may have been the most affordable uni I'd ever experienced with such great taste and honestly I would go back to Raku just to experience this dish again.\n\nArriving shortly after my first plate was finished - and with an explanation of all the little jars and bottles in front of me (a matcha sea salt, a house made soy, a japanese pepper + rice vinegar, and a chili infused oil) - Seafood with Bonito Guts Pickled in Salt looked and smelled much better than the name would arouse in one's imagination.  As others have mentioned, I really do not understand how this dish was a mere $6.  A heaping bowl filled with a mix of sashimi yellowfin, jackfish, salmon, mackerel, and sprouts each fish was extremely fresh and the sprouts lent some texture to the fleshy-melt-in-your-mouth fishes.  Topping the dish, according to my young server, was a combination of the house soy and the vinegar.  Adding a bit more soy to the already salty mix made the flavor perfect, in my opinion, though I do believe the dish could have benefited from some daikon or perhaps a crisp starch to add a bit more texture.\n\nThe next dish - well, let's just say it was so good that I ordered a second portion as my main course.  Entitled simply Steamed Egg Custard with Foie Gras the dish looked simple enough - a miso broth with scallions and a piece of Robata duck floating in the broth.  What laid beneath the broth, however, was the true treasure of the dish - a rich and hearty chawanmushi (egg custard) laden with ample accents of foie gras.  When stirred up with the wooden spoon the foie tones rose amply to the palate with the whole dish tasting like the combination of a sweet egg custard and an unctuous foie gras terrine.  While the grilled duck added a fine degree of texture to the dish, I personally thought the duck was a slight bit gamey - not bad, just not perfect.  \n\nSeeing this dish also offered in the noodle section as an Udon accompaniment I inquired from my server as to whether I could get that dish as a main course, but instead substitute the robata foie gras for the duck.  Not quite understanding my question my server went and got another server who understood perfectly, asked the chef, and assured me this would be no problem.  Receiving this dish after my robata choices and just before dessert I would strongly suggest anyone who attends Raku try this substitution for two reasons - number one, the manner in which the robata grill's high temperatures crisps the foie gras exterior while leaving the center fatty and smooth is unlike anything I've previously experienced - the charring actually mellows the foie all on its own and the texture is more \"firm,\" not unlike the roasted version I had at Blackbird in Chicago, actually.  Number two - those udon noodles served thin and cold to be dunked into a broth of foie gras, egg custard, and more foie gras...think \"chicken soup\" in its perfect form.\n\nBetween my two foie dishes I decided to indulge in a couple of Raku's robata skewers - Chicken Breast with Skin.  Fresh organic chicken wrapped in its own skin and cooked to crispy this dish presented some of the most juicy chicken I've had in some time while the addition of the skin added a crisp \"crackle\" without any breading - better than the Colonel without all the carbs and oil.  Adding first the soy and then the salt I have to say I was quite impressed by the manner in which the matcha's bitter texture worked with the savorieness of the chicken and salt.\n\nRobata course two was Kurobuta pork cheek and it, like the chicken, was excellent.  Typically quite fatty the high heat of the grill managed to melt the collagen perfectly while burning off some of the fat and only mildly crisping the skin.  The 'rarest' pork I've had since the chop at Babbo I found this to be my favorite, tastewise, of the robtata items and would compare it favorably to some of the better pork belly dishes I've had in terms of taste, texture, and fat to meat ratio.\n\nThe third robata course was something I've never eaten - Pigs Ears.  Sure I've had trotters, tail, tete, belly, cheek, and all the standard cuts - but not ear.  As others have stated - wow.  Crispy and salty on the outside, fatty next, and a thin chewy layer of cartilage in the middle - almost a 5-layer sandwich with each layer giving a different taste and texture experience.", "business_id": "xNcqwYAUeVOhe3KNC4Xjaw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-10-12", "type": "review"}

The fountains are definitely still a sight to see but in general you can start to see that it is definitely wearing down.\n\nUnfortunately, the folks at the Bellagio don't seem to agree as a stroll through the casino reveals high priced tables not below $15 sometimes and their buffet is 'ok' at best as I've eaten here several times and been unimpressed by the variety for my $30 of champagne brunch. \n\nFurthermore, the rooms are a little on the stuffy side, too old-English styled for me, or something. It also does take QUITE a long time to walk to your room as I remember walking from the strip to a friend's room and it taking a while after having to navigate the casino. I'm not the biggest fan and in my opinion I probably wouldn't stay here for how much they charge on a nightly basis.", "business_id": "-7yF42k0CcJhtPw51oaOqQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-12-07", "type": "review"}

Bang your head!\n\nI was at the Joint last night to attend a free concert courtesy of the Infocomm Show - big props to VER, JBL, and Panasonic! Three bands that sounded great and put on a terrific show. With each playing for an hour or so this was like watching a greatest hits of 80's rock anthems. Berlin surprised me the most at how good they were and Terri Nunn's voice was amazing. Brett is Brett - the eternal rock and roller and his set was full of energy and terrific songs. He just loves performing in front of a crowd. Cheap Trick brought the house down with a consummate set of songs such as Dream Police, I Want You To Want Me, Surrender, and so many other hits that they had over the years. Rick Neilson is still one of the best guitarists of his era.\n\nI was pretty impressed at the sound and acoustics here, considering the whole place is one big concrete floor room. The front of house guy nailed it, as each band sounded crystal clear, and the vocals were easily heard. The Joint is basically one big huge room with a concrete floor that angles down as you get closer to the upraised stage, so there are terrific sight lines no matter if you are in the front or standing in the back. There are actually three levels with the upper ones having seats and VIP booths. The main floor has a large pit area and then railed tiered levels as you head to the back. I tried a few different spots and all were a good view and sound. They also have some pretty cool lighting and effects over the stage and along the side walls.\n\nThere is a big bar on the bottom level that runs the length of the back area. Lots of bartenders and cocktail waitresses coming around for drinks. Easy access in and out of the place and pretty big bathrooms which is always a plus. I also had to notice the terrific air conditioning here. Even though it was crowded it was not at all hot and sweaty as many venues get. They also keep this place clean, as between each act a crew of people came around and picked up all the trash and mopped up any spills. Wow. Impressive.\n\nWould I come back here to see a concert? In a heartbeat! This is a great venue and it's so cool to walk out into the Hard Rock and gamble to even more great music.", "business_id": "vSAHvfM-ae7xKTOZ6XGMHw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-15", "type": "review"}

There were 5 of us so when the host showed us to our seat, imagine my surprise when the table had only been set for 4. We stood awkwardly around until the host grabbed a chair from a nearby table and we all moved around to make room. Eventually a bus boy also grabbed a place setting from a nearby table. We were not off to a good start. This should never happen in a fine dining restaurant. \n\nOnce we got settled with drinks in hand, a server brought out three kinds of fries with three sauces as a little appetizer for the table. Quite tasty and much appreciated as we were all starving. \n\nThe sommelier, Aaron, was quite good. We told him what our favorite wine was, and while they didn't carry it, he did find another Cabernet that was very good and actually made it on my list to have again. \n\nThe menu is set up with a cold shellfish section, first courses, specialties of the house and a more typical steakhouse menu with a range of steaks and sides. \n\nWe chose from each with some wins and losses along the way. The wins? The fresh oysters that change daily, the heirloom tomato and burrata salad, and the wedge salad were some of the best starters. For entrees- you can't go wrong with any of the steaks. All were perfectly prepared and the specialty lamb chops were also good. \n\nThe absolute best thing that we ordered was the lobster pot pie with truffle cream. This comes out in a copper baking pot with the crust on. They cut the crust off, placing it on your plate and then proceed to spoon the lobster and vegetables on top of it. Absolutely amazing! \n\nOn a side note -if you like lobster- don't order the poached lobster. It was way over cooked and so tough that we could not get a knife through it. They did end up taking this off of our bill, but again- surprising for a restaurant of this caliber to so over cook something. \n\nAnd a couple of the sides ended up disappointing as well. The asparagus was thick and a weird flavor from the olives and herbs surrounding it. And the hash brown cakes? Dry with the only flavor coming from the bacon that was on top of it. \n\nBut save room for dessert (in fact- this is so good you might just want to start with it) They have in house made beignets with three kinds of dipping sauce. Forget the chocolate and creme brulee dip. Only order the 18 year old real scotch butter scotch pudding dip. Absolutely the most amazing flavor! It makes any other pudding seem like, well secondary. \n\nService was efficient but not overly friendly. The bus boy was actually more helpful and pleasant and it was nice to hear him talk about the career path that this restaurant has for their employees. \n\nKnow before you go that this is not a cheap date. Dinner with wine and tip for 5 ran almost $700. For that kind of money, I really expected more than I got thus the lower rating. \n\nA-OK sums it up perfectly.

With that said I felt it was a very, very good choice.\n\nWe started with a cheese plate that had 3 types of cheese and accoutrements for a mere $14, which I thought was very reasonable. I appreciated the fact that they had a good assortment to choose from, I think around 10 cheeses. I also had a glass of champagne and Nick had a Chimay. Both of these I still found to be a pretty good deal, considering where we were in terms of city and restaurant style.\n\nAfter that we shared a salad with comice pears, smoked bacon and blue cheese, roasted fingerling potatoes with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and chives, and grilled asparagus in a lemon citrus olive oil in addition to our main entrees. I had a black angus Niman beef strip steak and Nick had a Berkshire Heritage pork with apricot chutney, both of which were cooked exactly the way we ordered them and were priced in the mid to high 30s.\n\nWhile, this was definitely an expensive meal it was also a meal worth the price. We had the dual servers so when one wasn't around to help us the other was no matter what we needed.

The joint is a really nice sports bar and grill....I've never been to a sports bar that was so nice before, I thought I had the wrong place when I arrived.  The restaurant is well kept and looks like it just opened, at least by the cleanliness and decor.\n\nSince I was alone, I saddled up to the bar and decided to eat and have a few Beers while I watched the game.  The menu is pretty extensive, so I asked the bartender for her recommendation.  She suggested the Boneless Wings ($7.99) or the Sliders ($7.99 + $.50 w/Cheese).....I said, \"What the hell, let's go for both!\".  I asked her to make sure the Boneless Wings were really Spicy.  Since I had been in China for the past 10 days I was in the mood for some heat.....she said that their hottest wing sauce wasn't that hot....but that the cooks could whip up  a Habanero Sauce for me.  I asked her to have the Boneless Wings prepared with Hot Sauce and put the Habanero Sauce on the side, just to be on the safe side, LOL.  To wash it down, I had a 22 oz SunUp Trooper IPA ($5.50).\n\nI watched the Lakers vs Suns game for a while and made some new friends at the bar while I waited for my food.  After a short wait the first dish to come out was the Boneless Wings.  The Habanero Sauce was so Hot that when they placed it down in front of me I choked on the fumes....and this was with the Sauce on the Side!  I had to move the plate off to the side, just so I could breathe....perfect!  I took one piece of Boneless Wing, dipped it into the Habanero Sauce, and took a bite....wow, it packed a big punch!  Very spicy and soooo good!  The Chicken was moist and juicy and cooked just right.....not too crunchy and not too soft....and full of flavor.\n\nThe Sliders came out a few minutes later....so I left 1/2 my Wing order to go try the Sliders.  There were 4 Sliders on the plate.  I tried it with a little Blue Cheese Dressing.....yum!  Then I dipped them in a little Blue Cheese then with the Habanero Sauce that came with the Wings....even better!  I told the bartender to tell the cooks that their Habanero Sauce was a huge hit and to thank them for me.\n\nIt took me a while, but I devoured everything I ordered.  2 IPA's later and with a Lakers' loss in the making, I asked the bartender to change up the Beer order and asked for her recommendation.  She suggested the 4 Peaks Peach Ale (22 oz $5.50)....ok, I normally don't do Peach flavored Beer but went with it anyway.  I'm glad I did, it had a nice smooth finish and you could barely taste the Peach flavor....it didn't overwhelm the brew.\n\nDespite a Lakers loss, I had a great time and meal here.  Kudos to the staff for making a patron happy by whipping up a spicy Habanero Sauce on the fly....you can almost feel the heat in the pics I took.\n\nWill I return?

The olive oil was infused so strongly with the garlic we all used the bread to soak it up and wiped the dish clean.\n\nI wouldn't ordinarily order pizza at a tapas place but the one here wasn't bad as far as pizzas are concerned. The crust was very thin and the toppings of chorizo, cheese and cherry tomatoes were balanced correctly -- not too much and not too little.\n\nAll in all, I'd have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this meal. I'll even go as far to say that the garlic shrimps were better than at my favorite tapas place in SF -- Zarzuela. Yeah, I said it. It's better! We ended up getting an extra order of the shrimp since none of us felt we had enough.\n\nThe meal wasn't cheap -- a pizza, 4 tapas and 2 glasses of sangria came to almost $80 with tip included. Still, for a highly satisfying meal, I don't really care if it was on the high side.", "business_id": "sH0gQB4t4kcDxY_MImHqYA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-12-28", "type": "review"}

The girlfriend and I hit the USA on holiday this summer and I wanted her to have dinner at Binkleys, one of my favourite US restaurants located in the small town of Carefree located just north of Phoenix\n\nLooking for nearby lodgings, I happened upon The Boulders. If you're familiar with the area, you'll understand immediately where ths resort is found - at the foot of the giant boulder stacks prominently jutting out of the flat desert landscape just outside Carefree\n\nLet me just get the one bad bit out of the way. I got a really good rate through Expedia, which included a $50 a day 'gift card', which we used for a free breakfast. This helped to offset the pain of the compulsory $30 a day resort fee. These resort fees are just a way to hide the true cost of accommodation and if they're compulsory, they should be included in the total cost quoted to guests\n\nIn the case of the Boulders, perhaps you resent paying the resort fee less because that brings 'free' wifi and free golf cart rides. Yup, golf carts are a near necessity because this is a big resort. We got a sense of this when we arrived at the security gate guarding the entrance to the resort. The security guard had a security pass ready prepared for us. He lifted the guard rail and instructed us to follow the road for a mile to main reception. It's a grand and exciting way to start your stay as you meander your way through the desert landscape and golf course towards the ever enlarging eponymous boulders\n\nAfter checking in, we and our luggage were transported by golf cart to our casita as our car was valet parked (compulsory). Wow was our reaction when we stepped into our accommodation. A huge room greeted us with all mod cons and a balcony with a view of the surrounding boulders. There were ceiling fans and air conditioning to keep the room nice and cool in the desert heat. The bathroom was equally cavernous. Truly the most luxurious hotel room I've stayed in\n\nThe resort has some signposted routes which brings you closer to the boulders if you fancy exploring these quite fascinating geological features. We instead headed to the spa to make use of the outdoor pool. The next day, we used the other pool near the main reception, which is open 24 hours\n\nWe had breakfast at an outside table overlooking the golf course, a lovely peaceful way to the start the day. The food was great\n\nIn conclusion, if you can get a good rate, don't hesitate to stay here. Oh, and make sure to have dinner at Binkleys just up the road", "business_id": "WFDxa8r0sT2ZnehYTyT1LQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-12-12", "type": "review"}

I had read about Rosemary's and liked some of the different dishes on their menu and so had booked a meal at this off Strip restaurant, allowing lots of time to get to Penn & Teller at the Rio for their evening performance.\n\nUnfortunately, the cab driver from my hotel had no idea where he was going and dropped me off in the wrong place. After 15 minutes of searching, I found out that I was in the wrong place, miles from the restaurant. As I hate being late for reservations, I rang Rosemary's to advise them about my delay and that I would try to get another cab. Well, I must have caught the companies at peak period and there wasn't a cab to be had for love nor money.\n\nAfter 30 minutes of increasingly desperate ringing, I rang Rosemary's back. The person on the end of the phone said not to worry and that they would try and get me a cab and they would ring me back. After 5 minutes, she rang back to say that they couldn't get a cab but that one of their regulars was on her way to pick me up!!!! A delightful lady duly arrived and we had a great natter in the car on the way over to the restaurant. What unbelievable service!\n\nAt the restaurant, they assured me that they would serve my food in time for me to catch my show and that they had already sorted out a cab for my trip to the Rio. If that was all they did, I would already be tempted to award them 5 stars for customer service above and beyond the call of duty alone.\n\nHowever, the food just reinforced the 5 star rating. I gather that Rosemary's used to be located at one of the big hotels - well, it's their loss. This food is vibrant, it's full of flavour, it's different and it's confident in itself.\n\nI plumped for the prix fixe dinner where there is a good choice of appetizers and entree with some choices attracting a supplementary charge. At my server's suggestion, I settled for one of the restaurant's signature appetizers - Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp. A flavourful interpretation of an old american favourite. I had the rack of lamb for entree and the meat was cooked perfectly. I'm afraid I can't remember the name of my dessert but a lovely sweet ending to the meal.\n\nAs it was such a fraught evening for me, the restaurant gave me some special home made chocolates to take away and enjoy at the show.

Crunchy on the exterior and just a bit toothsome within I'm still not exactly sure that I'm 'sold' on the way so many chef's flaunt the use of duck fat for fries but all things being equal these were really good, particularly the fine herbs interpretation.\n\nFoie Gras Duo with Roasted Bing Cherries and Almond Streusel:  While I generally eschew the restaurant week menu it was the non-RW appetizer that would prove to be the biggest failure of the meal and, perhaps, the biggest food failure I've had since moving to the valley - simply stated, this was a piece of foie that should have never made it to the kitchen let alone to the table.  Undersized, overcooked, poorly cleaned, and still somehow lukewarm on arrival there was really nothing to like about the seared portion of liver aside from the cherries - and least of all the veins and sinew zigzagging the palate.  Moving on to the second half of the duo a creamy terrine beneath cherry gel was presented and paired with buttery brioche it was nearly good enough to save the plate - but not quite, particularly as Christina's response to our complaint was simply taking the dish off of our bill rather than suggesting the chef take a second try with a better piece of foie gras and more attention to detail.\n\nCaramelized Black Mission Figs- Spicy Sopressata, Preserved Lemon Ricotta:  Rather horrified by the liver I was heartened by the first choice from the restaurant week menu; a sort of composed cheese plate featuring the intense fructose of fresh figs matched up against the bite of sopressata and lightly fragranced ricotta.  Like most Bay Area chefs I'd suggest that if a Mina restaurant is offering up a fig dish you'd be wise to order it.\n\nCrispy Sonoma Duck Breast- Cipollini & Brussel Sprout Hash, Huckleberry Compote:  One of three RW main courses and for my dollar the most obvious choice by a landslide the kitchen was gracious enough to serve us each a separate portion of the Sonoma margret and while I cannot say it soared to the same levels as Chef DeRuvo's version at Davanti Enoteca a few weeks prior this was another excellent preparation of my favorite protein with the aged fowl's slight must perfectly tempered by the pungent hash and sweet berry reduction.  Easily cut with the edge of a fork despite being served with one of the restaurant's signature steak knives and as tender as you could hope I'm still having trouble getting over the fact that I now live in a city where good duck exists at not just one but multiple restaurants.\n\nWhole Fried Chicken for Two with Truffled Mac & Cheese:  Yes it is $58 for chicken, but compared to the $200 Bresse at Savoy or the $78 version at The Nomad I guess you could call this brined, battered, and duck fat fried version a bargain if it was nearly as good as the others...and thankfully it was.  Featuring a plump hen with breading so dainty that it approximated the thickness of skin the bird was carved tableside and laid on a bed of truffled macaroni and cheese plus baby carrots before being topped with crispy onion rings and with each of the accoutrements quite delicious none were as good as the chicken itself - dense, moist, full of flavor, and complimented by rather than being overwhelmed by the seasoned breading.\n\nBourbon Bar- Dark Chocolate, Peanut Butter, Pretzel:  Seeing as how my writing is impossibly behind at this point suffice it to say I'd already experienced this dish at Baltimore's Wit & Wisdom and I was glad to revisit it as the alternate RW dessert.  Described loosely as the chef's interpretation of a candy bar this dessert beings with a core of sweetened peanut butter mousse and dresses it with dense 70% dark chocolate ganache before bespeckling it with crumbled nougat, peanuts, and finally chocolate covered pretzels.\n\nCarrot Cake with Cream Cheese Icing, Cr\u00e8me Fraiche Sorbet:  With Mr. Mathias stopping by to check in a conversation about Mina et al's approach to pastry ensued and after mentioning my fondness for his unique interpretations of American comfort foods we found ourselves gifted this one last plate.  Beginning at its base with airy spice cake flecked with carrots and studded with currants atop a smear of whipped cream cheese this dessert, much like the panna cotta, was taken to a whole different level through the addition of two frozen quenelles, one tangy cr\u00e8me fraiche and the other strikingly vegetal carrots.  Bite for bite the most delicious and complicated of the evening's three desserts this was just another exam  how Chef Mina understands the powerful effect of American comfort food.", "business_id": "8m08a9xJKmANwmeuR-0bPA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-01", "type": "review"}

Moving on to plates ordered as more guests arrived and having requested dishes arrive in logical progression it was the fluffy crab pancake that arrived first and laced with peppers the sweetness of the crab proved an adequate foil, a touch of soy bringing flavors to a point and transitioning well into the sweet, sticky wings - undoubtedly the plate of the evening and something I'd love to see the restaurant adopt in whole bird form once business picks up, though a subsequent course of crispy pork belly served with simply pickled vegetables was nearly as impressive...particularly with crispy glutenous rice cakes in thick, smoky 'ketchup' riding shotgun.", "business_id": "2pUJ5kwZRZNHDrrHTBrWMw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-01-13", "type": "review"}

Enoteca Otto Pizzeria has both indoor and outdoor (or pseudo outdoor) dining here.  To get the maximum faux design, you will want to eat in their outdoor dining area that is modeled after an Italian train station.\n\nThe pseudo outdoor area has nice tables.  At the center of the restaurant is a cylinder train tower that appears to be used for curing meats.  The canal shoppes surround this restaurant (fake buildings, statues that come to life and that blue sky, which I think looks better here than the skies at the Forum Shops or Paris).\n\nOtto (as well as its surroundings) features that Disneyfied decor/atmosphere, but it also has the backing of a celebrity chef (Mario Batali).  We went here for lunch and the pricing was reasonable (when compared to the many overpriced Vegas restaurants).  Pizzas went about $18 while pastas were about $20 or less.  You would expect to pay at least that for most sit-down restaurants in nice Vegas casinos.\n\nThe complimentary bread was packaged crispy breadsticks followed by focaccia bread (with olive oil and balsamic vinegar).  Standard stuff.\n\nWe ordered the tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto, and arugula pizza.  This is one of the better pizzas Mario Batali and Nancy Silverton serve at Pizzeria Mozza in West Hollywood.  This pizza at Otto was okay but not great.  The pizzas had a thin and crispy crust, but it lacked both the flavor and the chewy and crispy texture of the Mozza crust.\n \nThe flavor of the pizza at Otto was okay.  It was a little salty, but that is kind of common with these prosciutto pizzas.  The pizza had too much tomato sauce as it oozed out with each bite.\n\nWe also had the Brussels sprouts with pancetta.  Brussels sprouts can be a little off-putting, but I have had good versions of it like the Brussels sprouts salad with vibrant fruit at The Bazaar or the tender Brussels sprouts with salty pancetta and creamy parsnip puree at AOC.  These Brussels sprouts were boring in flavor.\n\nIn addition, the pancetta was not good.  It did not really taste like pancetta.  Instead, it tasted like country ham.  While I was not a big fan of the flavor, they were definitely generous with the portion size.\n\nBefore ordering, the staff informed me that none of their pastas were housemade.  It was disappointing, but we forged ahead and went with a thick spaghetti dish that came with tomato, cured pork and onion.  Unfortunately, the pasta was served a little cold.  Also, the tomato sauce looked like it had dried on the spaghetti; it appeared that it had been sitting around for a while (it also had that appearance of re-heated pasta though I doubt the cooks would do that here).\n\nThe flavor was not that great.  It just tasted liked cold tomato sauce. There was not much of the pork and onion.  My friends really did not enjoy the dish and asked the server to remove the dish.  Not something I would do.  No matter how bad I usually eat whatever is put in front of me.  What can I say?  I am a good guest.  The staff did kindly remove the item off the bill without further discussion.\n\nFor dessert, they were out of our first choice (fried dates) so we settled on a scoop of housemade salted caramel gelato.  The gelato was not well presented.  They filled the gelato in a cold sundae cup.  There was not much gelato above the rim of the sundae cup though.  It was flat too--like someone had flattened the top with a spatula.\n\nDespite the presentation, the gelato was actually quite good (and better than the gelato we had at Mario Batali's other and more expensive Vegas restaurant Carnevino).  The gelato was cold and creamy.  The flavor was good.  It was both salty and sweet.  They sprinkled some sea salt on it to give it a more pronounced salty taste.

Unfortunately, most of the food here was average to below average.  Otto is definitely a Vegas restaurant in how it makes the most of its faux but still nice atmosphere.

When it was first recommended to me, I expected it to be part of the Strip like any other high end eatery, and one that was in the confines of a casino resort. Instead, it is a Japanese establishment in the splendors of Chinatown.\n\nMy expectations were surprisingly low the first time around. I haven't had incredible experiences of the Japanese kind in Vegas just yet, plus I was less likely to put faith in a place that was more Asian fusion than pure Japanese as Raku seems to be. And in the seediness of Chinatown no less? I was already beginning to doubt its $$$$ rating.\n\nBut thankfully, my expectations were not only met but exceeded in every way. Everything was truly spectacular, from the small plates to the entrees and it was hard to pass up anything considering how fresh and tasty it all was.

I had a hard time NOT giving this place 5 stars. There were errors here and there that could have been taken care of and avoided but at the same time, it was all made \"right\" at the end. So, I really don't have any complaints. \n\nI was out here during the week of the 2012 Presidential election. The strip wasn't real packed. So, it was the perfect time to be visiting. With all the buzz about the election and the electoral votes, etc, my family and I had our eyes peeled with every TV screen we passed by. The most unfortunate thing was that our room was one of the ones that had been remodeled but in doing so, we weren't ever given the proper remote for the TV and we also weren't given a remote with a guide button that worked. Without a guide button, we also didn't know what channels we had access to or not. Boo! So that was one problem.  I asked the front desk about the TV. They said that they would send someone to bring us a replacement remote. I waited for 3 hours. THat didn't happen. I asked again when I was leaving the hotel, for someone to please leave us that remote in our room while we were out. That didn't happen. I finally turned on the TV, well tried to, but it was out. Apparently there was a casino-wide surge and tons of poker machines out on the gambling floor weren't working, the computers at the front desk weren't working and the TV's were not working. Oh joy!\n\nAnother problem for us was that when we had house keeping come, we were going through tissues in our room like crazy. I was suffering from crazy allergies and so was my auntie. When the housekeeping staff came, we never had our tissue supply replenished. So, I had to ask that housekeeping come to our room at 3AM when we had run out of tissue as well as toilet paper. That was issue number two. Again, keep in mind that all it took was a phone call and it was fixed. It was nice that I received what I'd asked for in about 10 minutes after making the phone call, not an hour or two.\n\nThe last issue was that some of our electrical outlets were not working. That was a bummer when we had cell phones and iPads to plug in and charge. \n\nThe hotel is on the strip, very close to the sign that welcomes you into Las Vegas. It's connected, via bridge, to the MGM. So, that was a nice stroll between the properties. The minute you walk in, it smells like cocoa butter and coconut. I like the smell but I'm sure there are plenty who are not fond of that scent. Our room was just as I had asked, 2 beds, near an elevator and on a lower level floor. I didn't want to get stuck in a hotel elevator with 45678943 other people who were coming and going in between each and every floor. I also had been given a pool view. That was nice, until I noticed that there was a guy outside my window after I'd come out of the bathroom from having taken a shower. I sure hope it was tinted. I called the front desk right away and asked who and why he was out there. I think he and I both kinda startled each other. Luckily, I had my towel wrapped around me but sheesh.  The desk told me that he was putting up some new banners and they should have let the guests know but weren't sure that they'd done it or not. Umm, OK great but do something about him!! They got him away from my window immediately. THanks!\n\nThe rooms are spacious and are pretty clean. I do it at every hotel, checked for bugs and bed mites and things. All clear!! The shower was nice and large. But, with as big a tub as we had, I had hoped that we'd received a stopper for our drain so that we could take a bath if we'd chosen to do so. I didn't mention this until the end of my stay. \n\nI stayed at the Trop for about one week. I got to know the ladies who cleaned my room. After the first time I met them, I asked them for a few things and that they make sure that certain items were always well stocked. After that, it went smoothly and perfectly. Occasionally, I would leave them a drink or snack with their tip. So, I'd say that we had a pretty good relationship for that week. \n\nThe decor is simple and on the more tropical side. The sundries store clerks are fabulous; charming and  very friendly. The beach cafe was perfect when I was craving a simple turkey sandwich. The prices weren't bad either. \n\nThe five stars comes from my not having to pay my resort fees, for the service that I received from the staff, for the assistance I received from the concierge and for the value of my money. I'd definitely stay here again if given the opportunity.\n\nI was lucky enough to book my one week's stay for under two hundred bucks.

Heydey no longer, more and more properties both new and renovated are creeping past Bally's as the decades roll along. Even then, Bally's remains a solid choice for the ever changing face of The Strip.\n\nAs a part of the Caesars Entertainment family, Bally's is a part of the largest gaming corporation in the world. Total Rewards lovers can earn and spend their points here where the comps are easier to utilize than higher end properties. The casino itself is rather average by today's standards with a solid array of slot machines and just under 100 tables. I'm pleased to report Spanish 21 is available here and a beefed up a poker room is available for hold 'em lovers.\n\nThe resort itself is as massive as it looks. Home to nearly 3,000 rooms, there is a good shot that there will be rooms here than a lot of the smaller places that sell out quickly. While the room rates will always fluctuate, the retail side of the hotel is reasonable for Vegas standards, especially when considering the middle of the Strip location.\n\nHotel dwellers take note: If you're going to be situated in the North Tower, be prepared for Las Vegas circa 1995 rooms. If at all possible, try to get a Jubilee room, the equivalent of the GO series at the Flamingo. It's contemporary, modern, and a true surprise for Bally's visitors. Concierge is on point as always, a huge plus considering the grade of the resort.\n\nThe best part of Bally's is also the most surprising: Major upgrades on the food front. Once considered the boring laughing stock of the local culinary scene, Bally's is now boasting one of the better steakhouses in the mid strip in Bally's Steakhouse (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ballys-steakhouse-las-vegas). Adding to the meat is their renovated buffet, the classic Sterling Brunch (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sterling-brunch-las-vegas) which has upgraded furiously not just in price ($40+ per person) but in the abundance of luxurious choices (especially on the sea food front) as well. BLT is set to come in sometime in the next few months and other quick bite businesses (::coughs:: chains!) will likely surface their lots come 2014.\n\nWhat's next for Bally's? Who knows. A face lift is most likely given the overhaul of Caesars property renovations but something tells me it'll all start from the inside out first.

Well thank heaven the city and neighborhood got involved and blocked that sale so that today, people can still enjoy great food and drink in a historic building.

It plays mind games with you, especially if you're a right handed hitter and slice the ball.\n\n- #8 Par 4 tempts all golfers as it is a driveable 326 (Tips), 308 (Blue), 296 (White)....with a little luck, you can get on the green or close enough for a short chip.  The killer is the water hazard on the front right side of the green that makes it very tight on the left.  Could be disastrous for right handed slicers.\n\n- #16 Par 3 is a manageable 212 (Tips), 180 (Blue), 155 (White)....small water hazard and a lot of fun.  My friends and I have had several close calls on holes in one on this hole.\n\nOther positives about the course is the driving range and the restaurant.

Which is why I had to book my guy four separate flights to get to and from a work conference in Orlando: one from LAS to DFW, another from DFW to Orlando, then the same in reverse to return, in order to get the best final price.\n\nFirst flight was delayed and then cancelled. No contact was made to alert me of this prior to arriving at the airport. Every other airline I've flown has texted and/or called me in a timely manner. Had to make two trips in one hour to our lovely airport to retrieve my guy. Staff had absolutely no ability to reschedule anything or come up with any possible solutions. This airline only seems to have evening/red-eye flights, so next available flight was 24 hours away, which didn't work for the conference we were travelling for in the first place.\n\nSince rescheduling with the same airline was not an option, had to shell out last-minute ticket prices for American Airlines- twice the price. Spirit has very strict policies/rules about when/how to request refunds, and I'm happy someone informed me that they are only able to issue one refund per trip per person. In other words, if your first flight has an issue, don't do anything about it until you have thoroughly completed your travel with Spirit. Because if you have additional issues getting home, they won't be able to do anything. Which makes no sense at all.\n\nReturn flight was also delayed, but luckily not cancelled. Which isn't to say it's wasn't without irritation. What was supposed to be a 11PM arrival barely made it around 1:30AM. Luckily I didn't have work in the morning.\n\nOverall flight experience is miserable. Tiny-ass seats, very strict luggage requirements, steep fees for every little thing, not even water is free of charge in the air. Basically, you can only travel with a lunchbox unless you want to shell out $40-50, because they will literally charge you $100 at the gate to CARRY ON a bag. Even if it's a duffel bag. Because lord knows if you ain't got no leg room, your weekend bag isn't likely to fit under the seat in front of you, either.\n\n**IF YOU ARE CARRYING ON LUGGAGE, take your bag to the airport and make sure it fits in their little container. Otherwise, the fees you pay will eliminate any savings you get on the ticket price.

The casino features a wide variety of gaming and had several restaurants on-site.  I saw a lot of advertising for Steak & Shake on the drive in and maybe because of that, the restaurant had a very long line.  This is the furthest west I've seen a Steak & Shake (I thought they came only as west as Texas).\n\nThe gaming tables are low with $3 minimum bets, but they dispense mostly $5 chips.  Still, your money can go longer here (and I was fortunate enough to win here on this trip).  For a Saturday afternoon, the casino had a good number of customers, but it was not too crowded.  Because of the smaller crowd, the smokiness of the casino was not too bad.\n\nThe staff was pleasant.  And maybe somewhat surprising (to me at least) was that the cocktail waitresses (at least on this visit) seemed more attractive than the ones I saw at the big Strip casinos that same weekend.\n\nSouth Point is a good last gambling stop before heading back to Los Angeles.  For non-gaming Vegas activities, you are probably not going to find much of that here.  For food, I am not familiar with a lot of the options (they may just be bad hotel restaurants) so you should probably try Steak & Shake first.  Good or bad, it will give you an opportunity to try a steakburger chain that is popular in the Midwest.\n\nA large parking lot and a large structure are adjacent to the casino (free parking).", "business_id": "1fjgZaW6_qTYoAaSCfI-VQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-04", "type": "review"}

It's one of my favorite conventions to attend here in Vegas.\n\nWith over 130,000 people expected at this year's CES I was prepared to battle crowds.  It wasn't too bad though.  I parked at the Las Vegas Hilton, which charges $30 a day to park there, but it's convenient to get in/out, so it's worth it in my opinion.\n\nThe registration process was very easy.  There was no line, perfect!\n\n*TIP* - CES has a registration booth at the Las Vegas Hilton and it's not nearly as crowded as the main booth at the World Trade Center.....so come here to register.\n\nI then headed over to the North Hall of the World Trade Center which is where all of the marquee companies are located.  I walked through the automobile electronics section, which was pretty cool.....think high-end and cool car stereo and entertainment stuff.  Then I went into the main hall where companies like Samsung, Microsoft, Intel, Sony, and other giants are located.  This year 3D TV's and 3D Entertainment seem to be the dominant theme on the main floor.  This really isn't groundbreaking as 3D has been around for a while.....I guess this is the year for the big push for it.  Lack of 3D Content is the big issue for these gadgets.  I also think wearing 3D glasses is ridiculous.....there's technology already out there that doesn't require them....it seems like it's already outdated, but companies are pushing it anyway.  I predict it will be a short term solution.\n\nIn the main hall, I also saw the new Samsung tablet...a potential competitor for the iPad.  I wasn't really impressed.  It worked well and looked nice, but not a game changer in my opinion.\n\nAfter screwing around the main hall for a while, I headed over to the South Hall....I wanted to see the new Blackberry tablet, which is going to be launched soon to compete with the iPad.  I found it on the 2nd floor of the South Hall with a large crowd around the display.  After a short wait, I muscled my way to the front to get a demo of the tablet.....I was pleasantly surprised with the functionality, navigation, speed, and lightweight of the tablet.  The integration with the Blackberry phone is also impressive.  The tablet also has true multi-tasking capabilities....just like a computer, you can watch a video, surf the web, and launch another application with no hiccup in performance.  That was amazing!  In my opinion, it's not a big game-changer, but it puts Blackberry back on the map to compete with Apple and Android.  I like this product and will anxiously wait for it to come out.  I was told Sprint would be the 1st cell carrier to have it.  Can't wait! (see pic here: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ks43LokM7OWst3BJTtt-6g?select=b5ZtjUFv738j0I0Nki8ZQw )\n\nAfter this, I was tired and wanted to head back to the Hilton to attend the CES Tweetup (different review).\n\nOverall, it was a good show.....well organized and always impressive.\n\nWill I return?  No doubt about it!\n\nSome Tips:\n\n- Wear comfortable shoes.  It's a huge convention and you will do a ton of walking.\n\n- Bring a camera with a lot of memory.

No pits, no stems, soft flesh and crispness to the skin - all told, excellent.\n\nWaiting only a short time my next arrival was the salad - or at least the dish listed as a salad.  Entitled Due Uova the plate was certainly overpriced at $14 but the taste/flavor certainly made up for it.  Featuring a creamy and rich risotto cake flash fried and filled with cheese the dish was next topped with a farm fresh hen-egg served sunny side and then accented with an ample portion of mullet bottarga - hence the \"two eggs.\"  Textural and rich the dish shined despite its price tag and once again showed off Batali's skill with eggs.\n\nArriving next was my pizza and fried item.  First off, Zucchini Blossoms with Picorino Fritti consisted of five flavorful and lightly fried blossoms loaded with a zesty pecorino that melted just enough to give contrast.  Light and sweet to complement the savory cheese, the blossoms were actually more fragrant that I was used to and had a great \"aftertaste\" that lingered on the palate.\n\nFinishing the blossoms I suddenly realized just how large the pizzas were and knowing I A) needed to spend $50 to use my certificate, B) wanted dessert, and C) had the previously mentioned dinner in a few hours I decided to only eat half the pizza - a half that turned into 4/6 of the pizza plus all of the toppings from the remaining slices after a couple bites.  Featuring a perfect and buttery cracker crust topped with pulled Ham hock, braised Endive, ricotta, and mozzarella the pizza was stated to be a daily special and it was incredible - possibly the best pizza I've had in a couple of years.  Smoky and savory yet sweet the ham was wonderfully tender while the crispy endive proved a nice foil with its mildly pungent tones.  The blend of cheeses worked well to accent the toppings without overwhelming, something I've found Batali's team particularly skilled at in past experiences.\n\nAllowing my servers to clear the table (at this point inexplicably still holding the plates of every dish I'd consumed) and to finally refill my water (only 1 refill during the 70 minute meal) I watched the \"Street performers\" while awaiting my dessert.  Feeling somewhat full I decided against the \"dessert du jour\" - profiteroles, and instead opted for one of Enoteca's signature gelato sundaes - Concord Grape Sorbetto, Peanut Butter Gelato, Peanut Butter Cookie, frozen Concord Grapes.  Presented beautifully with a small gelato trowel I proceeded to crumble up the cookie and take a taste.  First impressed by the incredibly \"grape-like\" flavor of the sorbet and its tart almost wine-like aroma I next took a bite of the smooth and creamy gelato - literally like a blend of butter and peanut butter but cold.  Finally, mixing the two - heaven - like the best peanut butter and jelly you've never had.  \n\nWhen it was all said and done my total bill came out to $57, or $35ish including my certificate - quite frankly, a steal for a Batali meal and especially in such a unique setting.  While clearly not as \"refined\" as Babbo or Mozza, I actually liked the atmosphere and food at Enoteca much more than that at Otto - I also didn't have to wait for 2 hours for a seat.  While service could have been better and prices perhaps slightly lower on the due uova, nothing was out of line and I'd certainly consider returning to Enoteca San Marco for a casual lunch on future visits to Vegas.

Satisfied but unwilling to leave Serendipity without sampling one of their signature sundaes the meal was capped with the carrot cake version, a substantial chunk of dense cake complete with cream cheese icing buried in ice cream, walnuts, fudge, and whipped cream that really had no chance of failing in the flavor department if you enjoy sweets, though perhaps a touch less 'subtle' than some like their breakfasts...or lunches...or dinners.", "business_id": "Xhg93cMdemu5pAMkDoEdtQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-10-23", "type": "review"}

I brought my Son along to witness the tomfoolery.  We opted to split an order of Potato Skins....yeah, I know B-O-R-I-N-G.....compared to the 4 lb Omelet, but I knew there was no way I could do it and I didn't feel like starting off my Sunday with a major stomachache.

Not only is it a giant Omelet....but it's covered in Gravy, and you must eat 2 Biscuits & Hasbrowns in addition to that thing in order to complete the challenge.

Free upgrade for the win!\n\nLast month I stayed here for the first time while on a business trip. Bally's is one of the older casino hotels in Vegas but has a prime location on the strip, is attached to the Paris, and also is a monorail stop location. Think of it as a no-frills hotel going in and you will be fine, as it does offer some of the most affordable room rates around.\n\nThe casino floor and rooms are decent but showing it's age. Yeah, it can use a renovation and brought into the modern era. Overall clean, and the casino floor is laid out so it is easy to maneuver. A nice mix of old and new games. Low limits can be found on table games. You still get that feel of the old Las Vegas vibe here. More than enough spots to eat but nothing to rave about. Their Blu Pool is actually quite nice and a great spot to hang out at during the day. They have a terrific gym that is well stocked with free weights and machines. All the staff I came in contact with were fairly nice.\n\nThe downstairs level houses the shopping area which has a nice little selection of stores, a terrific sports book, and a small food court. You also have to pass through here to get to the monorail. Feels like a mall out of the '80's.\n\nNow, I must have said the right thing to the front desk attendant as she hooked me up royally! I was joking around with her about getting the Presidential suite and she actually did put me in a high roller suite! Even funnier is that this was the kind of suite that you could imagine Sinatra and the Rat Pack hanging out in. It was old school cool. It was huge. Full bar, old style tv's and furniture, sunk-in Jacuzzi tub, large step up open bathroom and dual vanity area, floor to ceiling windows with an amazing view at night, and even a bidet! This room must have been the bomb back in the day. Well kept but a little worn round the edges from age and use. I could not believe I was staying here for about $40 a night.

Also, it's close to In-N-Out Burger with a few minutes cab ride! \n\nBally's might not have all the bells and whistles of the newer mega-casinos on the strip, but if you're crashing in Vegas on a budget it's a solid choice.", "business_id": "vT12uXtdBQ10_lUcl-M40w", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-07-10", "type": "review"}

I was the kind of sick that typically involves a deathbed and a Cholera diagnosis, so while everyone else drank deliciously hand-crafted brew, I crouched against the brick wall, in a dark corner of the brewery behind a bucket of coasters and naked Christmas tree, clinging to a sample of their Ginger-ale. Pretty sure it was the plague, because anything less and you know I'd have been all up on those taps. \n\nSo basically, this is going to be the lamest review of a brewery in the history of history, as I had only two sips of beer and then promptly went back to hunching over in my dark, concrete corner with a sample glass of ginger-y goodness, because OF COURSE I would get super sick for the first time in years on the day of our fateful road trip to Pittsburgh, that was taken with the purpose of spending time with old friends and drinking lots (LOTS!!!) of beer. Of.F*cking.Course.\n\nAaanyway, blah, blah, blah, my single sips of their winter white and Nunkin (no pumpkin) seasonals were dreamy and didn't make me barf at all--not one little bit. But the real star, and I know you guys are going to laugh, is that freakin' ginger-ale. OhMahGah it's so good! Seriously, just smell it. It's the most potent ginger scent outside of eating a bushel's worth of ginger root and puking it up so hard it comes out your nose. What? No. I mean, that's totally never happened to me... not with ginger at least (saganaki is a different story). But back to that ginger-ale: it's unreal. And luckily, exactly what I needed to fend off the urge to purge from my mystery illness (please not morning sickness. please not morning sickness. please not morning sickness.).  \n\nAnd while I loved my ginger-y ale and did end up leaving with a growler of it, the process to get said growler and aforementioned samples was pretty f*cking annoying and made even worse that there's not a single place to sit so because I couldn't bring my sick, sad self to even stand up straight I had to keep myself from yakking all over their merch by squatting in a dark, cave-like area as if I were some 21st century Smeagol. There was only one man working at 4pm on a Friday and a ridiculously long line wrapping around the register, merch and tasting area. The lone worker was filling growlers, answering questions, checking IDs, explaining crazy-ass Amish liquor laws, providing a sample of everything to everyone and running the register, which consisted of an iPad, and I'm not sure how familiar you are with businesses who use iPads as registers, but it's slow as f*ck, they have to type in every number and is a great way to really hold up an already mile-long line....

Since we had fallen in love with everything ENCORE.  We decided to eat at the nice restaurant inside of this hotel. \n\nWe were gambling at the tables and the pit boss was able to call in our reservation for a group of 14 with a table on the patio.  Great service to start!\n\nWhen we arrived, we were greeted by the hostess, which was probably the hottest girl we met on the whole trip.  Our table was laid out perfectly with a nice view of the pool that is part of club XS.\n\nThe pool had some nice eye candy to watch during dinner.  As we were dining, they were wrapping up the pool and setting up for the club, it was cool seeing what all went into setting up the club we were just at the night before. \n\nOn to the food.  I started out with the soup sampler.  It came with 2 soups, one was some artichoke soup which was average and the other was a mushroom soup which was amazing.\n\nOn to the steak.  I had the ribeye under the recommendation of the server.  I had it served \"pepper steak\" style which came with 3 dipping sauces.  My steak was a bit overcooked.  I ordered medium and it was more medium well, others who ordered medium rare it came medium, so I would recommend just under ordering your steak.  Out of the three sauces the brown sauce was the best. \n\nWe had a bunch of people so we had a wide variety of sides.  My favorite was the creamed spinach with fried egg.  The mac and cheese was hyped but did not live up to it.  I only got to try one spear of the fried aspargus and it was after it had cooled down but that was still excellent.  My friend didn't finish his filet so I had a few bites out of that.  The filet was much better than the prime rib.\n\nOverall, this place was elegant and the food was good.  Honestly, if you pick the right things this place could be a 5 star joint.  I just did not like the recommendations by the waiter. \n\nSo here goes my recommendations:\nGet the filet, order it 1 level less cooked than you actually want it, get it pepper steak style, get the creamed spinach, and sit on the patio by the pool.", "business_id": "3AlN2XZ0I0F8650y2yjLWA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-07", "type": "review"}

The show feels like a real spectacle and with the amazing stage, Ka feels like a show that you could only see in Vegas.\n\nThere are other good things about Ka.  I really liked how they made the show cinematic.  With the music and the great lighting, there are moments in the show that feel like you are watching a movie on the big screen (the best example is when they make the stage look like its underwater and with the curtain and lighting, it appears that one of the performers is saving someone from drowning and rising to the surface--very well done).\n\nThey try to tell a story with Ka too.  It is not a great story, but the story elements kept my interest in Ka more than Mystere (which was more like a series of disjointed vignettes).  Still, after a while, I felt like I had seen enough and I got a little bored.\n\nThere are definitely some strong acrobatics, but you might not see the big and more traditional acrobatics like you would see in Mystere.

I had wanted to try it the last time we were there, but couldn't because lil guy wasn't allowed in since it was served at the bar. So, we managed to find a daycare for him while we ran off to sample the 'black salt' (as hubby calls it).\n\nWe got there as it opened at 12pm and settled into comfy seats. We both ordered Perrier ($4.50) and was faced with a sour faced server. I was like WTF?? We're paying customers regardless of what we order. However, when I ordered a 30g Alverta caviar ($185) and hubby a shot of Christiania vodka ($10), that same server's entire demeanor changed. Fucking hell. I mean seriously. Just because we weren't dressed nicely doesn't mean we were vagrants. Give me a break.\n\nWell, I was kind of disappointed with the caviar. At $185/30g I'd expected far better quality than the one we got. I've tried many types of caviar before and I really preferred Osetra caviar to the Alverta but dammit, I wasn't going to pay $350/30g for it. Screw that. They serve the caviar with a 'bread basket' of toast triangles and baby blinis, but the problem was, the warm blinis served together with the toast created steam which meant the toast was soggy when it reached us. Also, the carb to caviar ratio was ridiculous. There was enough toast and blini for about 500g of caviar.\n\nStill, it was great that hubby finally has changed his thoughts about caviar. The caviar at Petrossian starts at $145 and tops at over $1000. Maybe one day I'll feel generous enough to plop down $300+ for 30g of caviar at a whim, but that day isn't going to be any time soon.\n\n1-star off for the two faced server.", "business_id": "_B1Q6lSkcWSSTVs8w4xv5A", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-08-23", "type": "review"}

I've dined at two of Robuchon's L'atelier restaurants (one in Tokyo and one in Vegas that sits right next to Joel Robuchon).  I enjoyed both of them.  They were French restaurants, but they were not too heavy.  They were more contemporary with light preparations and lively flavors.\n\nJoel Robuchon is a more formal and traditional French spot.  There are definitely modern touches.  Joel Robuchon updates several traditional French dishes to make them more contemporary; L'atelier though utilizes more modern techniques and even fusion elements to create dishes that feel entirely new.\n\nJoel Robuchon offers several menus including an option to build your own tasting of 2-6 courses or a full tasting, which is 16 courses and an incredible amount of food.  Regardless of how many courses you opt for, there seems to be enough mini courses (like an elaborate bread cart and an extravagant mignardises trolley) to keep you from leaving hungry.\n\nWith the bread cart and the mignardises trolley, I immediately thought Cyrus (a great restaurant that will be closing soon) when I dined here.  It also has similarities to The French Laundry in terms of the elaborate courses and the showcase of premium ingredients.  While I thought there were many great things about Robuchon, it was definitely not as good as those two restaurants.\n\nPart of it has to do with the produce.  I think Cyrus and The French Laundry have much better access to fresh fruits and vegetables.  The sourcing of the proteins is noticeable too.  Even though Joel Robuchon utilizes more premium ingredients than Cyrus, I felt Cyrus' proteins felt fresher and were handled with more care.  Because of this, I think the flavors pop at Cyrus and The French Laundry more.\n\nCyrus and The French Laundry also just serve up more contemporary and interesting food.  The food feels more with the times, lighter and more creative.\n\nThere were some great dishes at Robuchon though.  Caviar is nicely done here--paired with a cold and creamy cauliflower soup as well as fresh and soft hamachi sashimi.  The grilled lobster tail with herb sabayon was very good (great cooking of the lobster tail--very flavorful outside with a moist and soft inside).\n\nI liked the scallop too (nicely moist and served with a good leek curry).  The truffled langoustine ravioli was also good--nice thickness on the pasta.\n\nThe caramel panna cotta, which also had a great ice cream, was very satisfying even if the garnish of strawberries was not that great.  And the attention to detail on the bread and mignardises really paid off.  The gruyere brioche was light, crispy and cheesy and the mignardises trolley featured an unbelievable amount of variety including chocolates, lollipops, little cakes, marshmallows, pate de fruit, caramels, macarons, and so on.  The best thing about it was though that despite the huge number of mignardises they make, several of them were very fresh and good.\n\nBut there were definitely spots where Joel Robuchon struggled when compared to California restaurants.  Their tomato salad is supposed to be bright and vibrant as well as very modern.  Unfortunately, the tomatoes were not nearly as sweet and juicy as what you will find at Lucques (Lucques has a better flavor combination too by featuring fragrant basil and creamy burrata).  The Bazaar's caprese salad is also much more modern than Robuchon's tomato salad.\n\nRobuchon's salmon is very nicely cooked, but I didn't like the flavors of mango and mustard that they chose to go with it--both strong flavors and a little too contrasting.  The beef ribeye here was very flavorful and tender, but the garnish of capers was too overpowering.  I was excited about trying their chocolate souffle and it had a great lift, but it had a weird texture.  It was almost like a marshmallow.  It made the souffle feel dry--maybe more vanilla bean ice cream or a creme anglaise would have helped.\n\nService was very polite, professional and attentive, but I felt it was too stiff.  It is probably just the style that they are going for, but Cyrus manages to be both formal and personable.  The dining room is very formal and high-end too.  I wasn't a big fan of all the decoration though--it made the room feel cluttered.\n\nPrices are very high, but they do serve a generous amount of food.\n\nJoel Robuchon provides a very extravagant dining experience and one that you cannot easily find elsewhere.  Still, I prefer L'atelier much more and I would highly recommend The French Laundry over it.  But it is a very renowned restaurant and worth considering if you want to try Vegas' best.\n\nMGM Grand offers both complimentary valet and self parking.", "business_id": "wfofFm3AqtyK_ujNQ893mQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-09-16", "type": "review"}

Featuring a farm-fresh menu focused heavily on Wisconsin purveyors with floor-to-(20+foot)-ceiling windows offering wide views of the midday bustle outside it was near the rear of the restaurant that I opted for a shaded seat and with a menu of daily specials alongside several signatures a three-course meal of small plates was created, the service itself perfectly pleasant in offering up apologies for long delays from a kitchen that was dreadfully slow in preparing something as simple as a charcuterie board despite the restaurant being less than 1/3 full.  Certainly not starving after a hearty breakfast it was after nearly thirty-five minutes that my selection of three cheeses and two meats with several house-made accoutrements arrived and with each item tallying $3-to-$3.50 aside from the ultra-aged cheddar I'll simply say the additional $5 surcharge was entirely worthwhile, a sharp bite to the golden wedge better than any I tasted in England and just inching out the pate de Campagne for best thing on the pig-shaped board.  Having mentioned issues with the kitchen I was unfortunately only a quarter into the charcuterie when my three hot plates arrived and setting aside the cold board with a bit of annoyance I found even more frustration with the overcooked pork belly, a limp and flavorless bao doing little to improve the flavor as pickled cabbage dominated each bite.  Moving past the buns to things far superior it was next in Graze's signature curds that I did partake and squeaky-as-hell with plenty of brine I greedily dipped each bite in ranch - a flavor I generally dislike adding an aromatic finish to each bite.  No less impressed by a salty pretzel with delicate chew beneath a soft, golden top it was back to the charcuterie that I turned as plates were collected and opting for one of three desserts another long delay would transpire, the twenty minutes thankfully justified by a hot slice of pie loaded with nuts and molten caramel atop a crisp and buttery crust.", "business_id": "cmv6wUUe-H0xRiFEY0__iQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-09-18", "type": "review"}

I was impressed with Todd English's food at the LA Food & Wine Festival and had high hopes for this one (even though I knew that Todd English PUB was going to be much more casual and simple fare).\n\nThe atmosphere was very raucous.  It very much had a gastropub feel and it was quite loud.  There was also a seating area outside with heat lamps (unfortunately, since Todd English PUB is located in a congested area, you have to deal with several smokers nearby).\n\nThe menu consisted of a wide variety of food from several fried appetizers to burgers and sandwiches as well as some English pub grub like fish and chips and bangers and mash.\n\nWe started with the ahi tuna on wonton crackers, which was the best dish of the night.  While expensive, the starter was good.  The ahi tuna was nicely mixed with seaweed and gingered sesame vinaigrette.  The tuna mixture sat on light and crispy fried wontons.  The tuna was fresh.  It was also quite spicy.\n\nI also had the bangers and mash.  The mashed potatoes were good.  They were very light for mashed potatoes and had a good flavor.  They kind of reminded me of the mashed potatoes at Nick & Stef's in Downtown LA.  The bangers were quite bland though.  They were moist enough, but they had very little flavor.  They sat on a creamy mustard sauce, which was also bland.\n\nI tried some of my friend's fries, which were just okay (a little soft).  My friend mentioned that the fish and chips were bland.\n\nService was decent.  The staff was friendly, but it was hard to flag down our waiter at times (which is a common problem when you eat outside and the outside dining area is not that connected to the inside dining area).\n\nPrices were not too bad for Las Vegas.  There were several entrees below $20.  However, for the quality of food, you can find better gastropub food in other cities at similar or lower prices.\n\nThough we liked the ahi tuna on wonton crackers, the entrees were very disappointing and I am not sure if the other entrees would be any better.  I did like the little sampling of Todd English's food at the LA event (and he is a very charming, funny and smart guy), but I think his more upscale Olives in The Bellagio is probably a better representation of his skills in the kitchen.\n\nTodd English PUB is located right next to Aria.

Admittedly benefitted by the 'event' and thus afforded the ability to sample widely as Ms. Caldwell smiled on and educated the crowd it would truly be difficult to decide exactly where one would be best advised to invest on a first visit to JinJu but, with items all trending more affordable than Strip legends like Jean-Philippe or Vosges, the truffles are definitely a good start - each $1.75 bauble beautifully crafted with flavors like Honey, Matcha, Figs-Red Wine, and Tahitian Cream set to tantalize even the most sophisticated of tastes.  Equally gifted In crafting whimsical items including pretzel rods, chocolate covered Twinkies or cookies, nut-clusters, and a decadent gluten-free brownie another focal point for those seeking something special are Jin's bars - the 702 Mob particularly impressive - and most of all the collection of Fortunato 4 wafers, each piece of the single origin chocolate a slowly melting tribute to exactly what can happen when exquisite ingredients meet the hand of someone with so much skill and passion.", "business_id": "55eUwxPXxSozPl-cYQQnMA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-28", "type": "review"}

Hands down this is one of my favorite places to dine when I am in town, and I can honestly say I have never been disappointed. This classic French bistro serves magnificent food in a wonderful atmosphere, and at a fair price. Thier position on the strip also offers a terrific view of the Bellagio.\n\nAs soon as I boarded my flight from NY this morning my mouth was drooling with anticipation. Thier steak frites are absolutely amazing, and will melt in your mouth with orgasmic bliss. I knew that I would be dining alone tonight, so I did not even make a reservation as the bar area is a great spot to eat here, especially the one out facing the strip with a view of the Bellagio water show. I just winged it and ended up with a prime spot sitting and conversing with other single visitors in town enjoying a meal at the bar.\n\nI ordered  a glass of Pinot Noir, and chose the Steak Frites Bordelaise. Tender steak sliced thin, almost like a flank steak, with carmelized onions, and a red wine sauce ladeled over the top. Crispy and thin frites with just the right amount of saltiness accompanied the steak. I bit into the first bite and - OH -MY-GOD - I wanted to melt off my bar stool right then and there. The exquisite taste of the steak along with the carmelized onions just put a smile on my face the whole time I was there. I think everyone around me had the same look of satisfaction from what they were eating too. I went absolutely all piggy and finished every bite of steak and frites on the plate. I even soaked up the extra sauce on the plate with this amazing hot mini baguette of crispy bread they serve with the meal.\n\nIt was all so good I totally ignored the booming sounds of the water show going on across the street. As I settled up the bill I was glowing in the aftermath of total satisfaction. Just a perfect place to have a great meal in a civilized atmosphere wether it be a date or a group. As I walked down the street back towards my casino hotel I felt as if I was floating two inches above the ground.

A small space situated next to apparent brunch favorite \"The Windsor\" I admittedly drove right past the small shop at first due to the lack of signage but catching my mistake quickly I took a right and then found myself at the complimentary valet who assured me he could either park my car - or that I could take one of the fifteen minute spots in front of Churn, a much more logical option.\n\nDisembarking from the car and making my way past a family through the doors it was no more than 5 seconds after I entered the door that I was greeted by a friendly woman and with kitsch and candy dominating the space outside the case I was offered a taste of \"any and all\" that eventually turned into a taste of Vietnamese Coffee, Toasted Coconut, Butter Pecan, Double Chocolate, and Peaches and Honey Ice creams as well as a Peanut Butter Bar.  With the textures very creamy, almost like gelato, and fresh flavors focused on subtlety without being excessively sweet - particularly the peaches and honey as well as the toasted coconut - I will admit that making a decision of two flavors in a cup/cone vs. a cookie sandwich was tough but in the end I just couldn't pass up a fresh baked Snicker Doodle and Chocolate Chip cookie wrapped around Butter Pecan.\n\nBeginning first with the ice cream, I will admit that overall I probably enjoyed the flavor (and novelty) of the peaches and honey a bit more than the butter pecan, but when taking into account what would work best with the baked goods the subtle toasty notes of the butter pecan won me over along with the texture - like thickened almond butter without chunks or whole pecans at all.  Moving next to the cookies, I would have probably deferred had it not been for the Snickerdoodle but rife with cinnamon and butter I simply couldn't pass up my favorite childhood baked good while the chocolate chip was also good, but certainly not better than those made by my aunt or many other bakeries.  A nice space with great service I'd certainly go back, though in the future I'd go with more stomach space to try one of the designer sundaes...plus a few more cookies served up warm as opposed to cooled by ice cream - perhaps sometime when I check out the brunch next door.", "business_id": "tAmevVP8B7PiWxcJ0PlYVA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-14", "type": "review"}

A meticulous planner, my dinner reservations going into Vegas were mapped out months in advance and my breakfast details planned out extensively.  While my lunches were unscheduled, I generally knew where I wanted to go and generally went there.  When my best friend decided at the last minute that Enoteca San Marco wasn't something he was interested in and suggested \"something asian maybe\" I remembered hearing good things about Sensi and turned to it as an alternative since my buddy had been so agreeable to places like MiX and Alex which weren't really his \"scene.\"  Tucked in the back of Bellagio and pretty tough to find, unfortunately Sensi wasn't tough enough to find.\n\nSeated immediately near the admittedly awesome bread prep station, our 'waiter' Jeremy W briefly asked \"sparkling or flat\" and my friend stated flat.  We were brought an already opened bottle of Fiji and two glasses of ice.  When I suggested tap water would be fine, the 'waiter' stated \"Well, the bottle is already opened.\"  The bottle cost $8 and was not comped despite our not wanting it.  Approximately ten minutes later menus were brought and essentially dropped off without explanation.  The waiter then returned approximately 10 minutes later with some Naan to go with our empty condiments (every other table was served fresh soy, salt, mustard, and tomato pepper chutney with their Naan...I had to stand up and get my own.  Orders were taken and this was the last we'd see of Jeremy until he delivered the bill.\n\nBrowsing the restaurant I must admit the d\u00e9cor was beautiful and watching the chef prepare the Naan was interesting.  After one basket of the delightful and doughy yet crisp bread topped with spicy chutney a non-descript server arrived and removed our basket, later returning with fresh bread.  This was the best service we received at Sensi.  \n\nAfter around 20 minutes our mains arrived, myself ordering Oven Roasted Diver Scallops with Basil Risotto, Zucchini, and Eggplant and my friend opting for the Shrimp and Beef with Duck Fried Rice.  All things being equal, the food was decent but certainly no better than I've had at far cheaper restaurants with vastly better service.  My scallops were a tad overdone but certainly fresh and tasty while the Risotto was soft yet consistent and contrasted well with the vegetables.  My friend additionally noted his dish was \"pretty good.\"  Portion sizes were adequate but certainly not excessive considering the $20+ pricetags.\n\nAnother 15-20 minutes passed after the meal and thankfully I was seated close to the server's station where I was capable of filling my own glass with tap water because during that time no on arrived at our table.  Eventually Jeremy reappeared and without asking about dessert or anything else he delivered the check and collected our dishes.  \"Have a great day\" he said.  To be fair, it wouldn't have taken much to be a great day after such a disappointing meal with such lousy service.  The total bill was $56.03 and our most affordable meal of the trip.  No tip was left as no tip was deserved...I've had better service at Denny's.  \n\nThe only plus of the meal was that on the way back to the sportsbook and gaming floor we had to pass by the beautiful Bellagio gardens and Jean-Philippe where I ordered the best Tiramisu I've ever had.  Moral of the story?  If you're on your way to Sensi just stop, grab some tiramisu and gelato and watch the chocolate fountain.", "business_id": "aYEs_eXqnV8Ifj3Bp0bHwQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-10-05", "type": "review"}

Owned by Eliot Wexler and considered by many locals 'in-the-know' to be amongst the best restaurants in the city I knew I would eventually make my visit, but it was not until the high praise of new chef Claudio Urciuoli's cuisine and a ringing endorsement from Steve Plotnicki via facebook came across that I moved noca to #1 on my list.  With a concept that seems rather straight forward - high end ingredients prepared with an Italian twist in a casual environment - I generally assumed that noca was going to impress, and at a price point that seemed bargain basement compared to similar establishments in New York, Chicago, and elsewhere.\n\nThe Reservation:  For the sake of full disclosure I have to note here that I was known walking in the door.  Between Steve's endorsements that I must meet his friend Eliot and another local diner who'd apparently told Mr. Wexler about me months before I figured it was only proper to introduce myself to the restaurant's owner prior to making a reservation - an introduction that led to a string of e-mails covering everything from sourcing to local general contractors, and finally a reservation at 8:30pm on Saturday night (actually secured ~18 hours before the meal via Opentable.)  What I hadn't planned on, however, was a stop earlier in the day to check out the afternoon 'nocawich' menu...but hey, why not?\n\nThe Space:  Located, like many Phoenix restaurants, in a simple strip mall the exterior of noca is nothing to get excited about - it could be any random sports bar or billiards hall, but what lies inside is actually quite sleek; a sort of urban industrial feel but still sort of homey and laid back.  By day more casual and by night more trendy the use of industrial light bulbs plus spotlights and mirrors allows the room to be as intimate or as bright as necessary and with an open kitchen during both lunch and dinner service there is plenty to watch.  With a lively bar, close set tables lacquered in black, and brick walls plus a lively soundtrack I will say the space gets loud, but certainly not overly so, and for those who enjoy watching a kitchen at work the marble chef's counter is a great place to eat. \n\nThe Service:  Considering how busy noca was (not an empty seat in the house save for the one to my left) I was stunned at the fluidity and efficiency of service.  Dishes were presented with ample descriptions, questions of ingredients and preparations were answered thoroughly and knowledgably, and aside from a few small quirks (that the average diner would have never paid a second thought to) my primary server named Jenny could not have been more pleasant, professional, or helpful with her suggestions.  A lively spot where many patrons probably don't really pay attention to the quality of the service I'll simply say I've been to a number of Michelin starred spots with a far less impressive front of house.\n\nThe Food:  A sandwich and dessert at Nocawich at lunch/two drinks, eight courses, bread, amuses, mignardises at dinner.\n\nCroque Madame with Pork Belly, Brioche, Fried Egg, Gruyere Foam:  This $10 sandwich from the Saturday Noca(wich) menu would feature a slightly modernist update on the French classic and as much as I love the combination of ham, egg, and cheese in all forms this one raised the bar a bit by utilizing tender belly bacon from Mr. Wexler's supplier out of Iowa paired with crisp brioche, a perfect sunny side egg, a thin slice of aged gruyere, and finally an aromatic foam from an ISI Whip that made cheese whiz seem tame in comparison.  As good as the lobtah roll sounded, I find it hard to believe it would have trumped the croque - but I'm certainly going back with my BOGO from dinner to find out.\n\nRed Velvet Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting:  Simple, dense, moist, and featuring an ample amount of tangy cream cheese icing there really isn't much else to say about this cake.  Not overly sweet like so many 'designer' cupcakes the $3.50 rustic wedge was a welcome change from the norm - the cocoa allowed to shine rather than taking a back seat to the sugar.\n\nDinner service will be an addendum...", "business_id": "DcrM4hwDcU2G6vuh2cnaYQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-11", "type": "review"}

Tired but excited I walked in and mentioned I had a reservation for one to which the beautiful attendant stated \"Ah yes, Dr. U, we've been expecting you.\"  At this point I was handed off to a team of fantastic servers who showed me to my window-side 4-top and the extravagance began.  I'll get my complaints out of the way early....there was a spot on the tablecloth approximately the size of match-head...no more complaints.  Perfect service, flawless timing, full descriptions, elaborate presentations, the gorgeous interior and fountain show outdoors....and a customized tasting menu as follows:\n\nAmuse Bouche:  Komomoto Oyster w/ American Caviar - I'm not an oyster guy, nor a Caviar guy, but the presentation was gorgeous and the flavors far more subdued than past tastes.  While I cannot say I'll ever appreciate these two items as much as other haute-cuisine, I can definitely say I'll look forward to my next unexpected encounter.\n\nBread Basket:  Pretzel, Walnut Olive, French Baguette w/ salted and unsalted butter.  The Baguette was crunchy and perfect for soaking up sauces, the pretzel crispy and salty outside and buttery soft inside, and the olive walnut simply sublime.  Better Pretzel than Mastros or Yankee Stadium, Better olive than Gramercy Tavern.  Runner up to Spago for best basket all time.  Better yet - After the first three courses I'd eaten one piece of each and went to grab another piece of Baguette for sauces when the waiter whisked it away and replaced it with a piping hot fresh basket stating \"it isn't as good when it cools.\"\n\nCourse One:  Lobster Salad w/ avocado, frisee, hericot vert, black truffle - A Le Cirque classic and for very good reason.  Beautifully poached lobster over a puree of avocado and hericot verts, a layer or frisse, and a drizzle of black truffle dressing topped with a shaved black truffle.  Delicious as it was decadent, a beautiful way to start.  (note: the truffle was fresh and quite good, but certainly more for effect than taste....like plastic surgery on a super model....it was already great, but here is that extra unnecessary touch.)  \n\nCourse two:  Sauteed Foie Gras w/ microgreens, petite chestnuts, white peach, blackberry, cranberry - Sublime.  Fatty and flawless inside, just slightly crisp outside.  Served warm and sweet with a brilliant contrast against the tart berries, crispy peach, and crunchy nuts with the microgreens added for texture.  While not quite as innovative as the version at EMP, better in flavor.\n\nCourse three:  Crispy Sweet Breads w/ Fig and grape marmalade, veal reduction, butter basil foam, asparagus/heirloom tomato/mushroom salad - A substitution for the seasonal risotto and absolutely worth the decision.  A single sweetbread panflashed and crisp served beneath an airy butter and basil foam over a flavorful salad the dish was further enhanced by the addition of two smears of fig jelly that provided a sweet component to the already incredibly savory dish.  The veal reduction was poured in a small ring around the dish tableside and was my first experience with what the sous-chef could really do...until dishes four and five.\n\nCourse four:  Paupiette of Sea Bass with Pinot Noir sauce, crispy potato skin, microgreens and shredded savoy cabbage - Another Le Cirque classic and another winner in every way.  Perfectly poached bass with a crispy paper-thin skin served over a crispy salad and covered with a sauce that can only be described as heavenly.  Sweet and winelike yet bold and buttery, refined yet complex....more bread, please.\n\nCourse five:  Organic chicken w/ Foie gras macaroni, truffle, asparagus, tomato compote - My second substitution as I don't favor beef and a second wonderful choice.  Clean and tasty chicken with thin shavings of black tuffle beneath the crispy skin served over a layer of long handmade macaroni and a transcendent sauce of mushroom puree and foie gras.  Wonderfully crisp asparagus and a beautifully complex grilled tomato compote lent additional flavors to the dish, as well.\n\nPalate Cleanser:  Tequila Sorbet with gold leaf, dragon fruit, dinosaur plum, coconut milk, and edible bowl - More pineapple than tequila, this sorbet was divine and a mere sign of things to come.  The fruit compote was delectable and the coconut milk wonderful for offsetting the citrus.  I'd like to say I knew the bowl was edible, but initially when I broke it I was worried....I think this was expected as my server then stepped in to suggest I \"try a bite.\"  The gold leaf....we'll chalk that up to extravagance, it had no flavor.\n\nSee profile site for full review with formatted pics.", "business_id": "4EhFsjWBSaSp_5TkkLp7LA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-09-29", "type": "review"}

Even the Heinekins were, like, $12 or $14 (I can't remember because at that point I simply stopped looking, because the only way to enjoy myself was to pretend like I wasn't getting raped by the bartender every time I was thirsty). \n\nOverall, it's an alright club. Not a single girl on stage did anything other than strut around (disappointing when you're from Portland and the girls here do insane pole acrobatics) so there's ZERO reason to sit at the rack. Drink before you go, or maybe go for the bottle service? I generally avoid bottle service, but the drinks are so expensive that it might be worth it. You're better off showing up toasted or smuggling in a flask. \n\nThis is definitely not my first choice for adult entertainment in Vegas unless someone else is footing the bill. The level of \"luxury\" they offered me (standard strip club chair, standard strip club table, same drinks as anywhere else) is not worth the luxury price I paid. Maybe if a high-roller is rolling with me footing the bill, I'd be into it. \n\nIt blows the Rhino out of the water, tho.", "business_id": "sbPAI0IBqqK54_rg0C_Sxg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-24", "type": "review"}

Trays of food being 'tampered' with freaks me out! I haven't been to a buffet in ages -- at least not the last 3 times we've been to Vegas, but this time, I had a craving for peel and eat shrimp. I don't eat much else at a buffet, so I said let's go to the Orleans for their buffet since it's really cheap and I know they have peel and eat shrimp.\n\nOK so the pricing was super cheap -- it's $7.49 for lunch -- and it includes non-alcoholic beverages. There were the usual bbq stuff, Mexican stuff, Chinese stuff, Italian stuff, and an attempt at Mongolian bbq, which was rather dismal. \n\nI had about a pound and of a half of shrimp, a few slivers of bacon, 3 corn on the cob, a swirl of vanilla ice cream with crushed peanuts, 3 glasses of iced tea and I was done. I remembered last time they had these fantastic cookies, but there wasn't a cookie in sight. On top of that they have added a gelato station, but all the desserts were handed out, you couldn't help yourself to them.\n\nFor me, this buffet suffices because I don't really eat much at a buffet. Usually, I'll eat peel and eat shrimp, smoked salmon or trout, and lamb chops if they have them. What's the point of paying 20 bucks when that's all I eat? \n\nThe buffet at the Orleans is fine by me. It has the shrimp, and I'm happy to pay $7.50 for it! I must say I remember there to be more selections so I have to deduct a star for this visit.

Featuring an extensive menu of Japanese classics arranged under headings such as grilled, steamed, and fried plus a handful of daily specials as Chef Komada watched over a team of four in the open kitchen it was with an eye toward variety that we placed our order and with a complimentary cocktail to begin nearly every one of our nine items proved excellent, particularly considering a total bill inclusive of tip less than $30 per person.  Starting first with cold selections and then proceeding through those grilled and hot it was with impeccable skill that traditional options like robatayaki, grilled squid, and chawanmushi shined but far more interesting and thus more impressive were items trending toward esoteric, both the hot and cold mountain potato dishes absolute show stoppers in terms of texture and flavor while tempura selections proved innovative and light.  Moving on to dessert, a decision left in my hands, a selection two sweets arrived and while the tofu mousse was admittedly quite light the general lack of flavor proved rather underwhelming in its own regard and all the more so next to a pair of crispy yet supple matcha spiked waffles topped with a hefty scoop of vanilla ice cream and sidecars of liquid butter and honey, the end effect every bit as delicious as the Honey Toast at Ichiza or Serenade but with a slight bitter undertone adding a touch of intrigue, an upgrade on a classic that seems to typify much of the restaurant's cuisine and all the more reason to come back soon.", "business_id": "h83afVKqwBlA-zOu_vdtEw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-12-18", "type": "review"}

After all, what's not to like about a darling atmosphere, amazing food and servers who love what they do?\n\nA big thanks to Yelp Edinburgh as I was looking for a place not too far from my hotel to have dinner.  I had done plenty of pubs so on this night, a finer dining experience was in order.  Checking out my local Yelp connection put this on a short list and after calling to get a reservation, was able to get in the same night.\n\nIf you go- know that this intimate restaurant is located on the second floor of the building.  Ask for the cute table for two in front of the window and you won't be disappointed.  We sipped our wine as they lit the candle on the table, watching the people walk by on the street below us.\n\nThey are known for their casseroles and on this night they had three available- one with sausage, one with lamb and one with rabbit.  My friend opted for the rabbit casserole and I went with the trout entree.  As for starters- you can't go wrong with the mussels . . . . .these were so good as the white wine sauce had blue cheese in it as well which perfectly complimented the mussels.  Soaking up all that delicious sauce with the crunchy bread almost spoiled my appetite for my trout but I persevered!\n\nMy trout was pan fried and served over mashed potatoes.  And my friend's casserole was perfection on a plate and I loved that they served a portion of it to him leaving the rest for him to spoon out on his own.  The sauce alone would have me coming back.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough- check out the dessert menu.  I think I died and went to heaven when I took my first bite of the sticky toffee pudding.  This gingerbread like cake was covered in a rich buttery toffee sauce and served with ice cream.  I threw my diet to the wind and basically ended up licking the plate (not really . . .but I wanted to!)\n\nThe food is amazing at this little understated place.  And the prices?  Reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food and service.  Dinner for two with wine and dessert ran about 86 pounds.  \n\nI am heading back to Edinburgh in a couple of weeks.  You can bet that L'Escargot Blanc is going to be on my \"go to\" list.

Those perfect evenings that you think about for weeks. With just the right combination of the company that you are with and the place where you are. \n\nEnter Valentines Day weekend. I found myself in Charlotte visiting a dear friend. After cocktails in the Ritz lobby bar, we were seated in a quiet table in a back niche of BLT- the perfect place to relax and catch up. \n\nThe decor is modern with out being uncomfortable, the service spot on and the food delicious. \n\nWe started with a couple of appetizers, fresh oysters and tuna tartar. The presentation of the tun tartar was lovely with a layer of avocado and the chunks of fresh tuna artfully arranged. The bread that comes to the table is light and chewy- served with freshly salted butter. Delicious. \n\nFor dinner- when in Rome- do as the Romans do, so steak was the name of the game. I had a perfectly prepared New York strip steak that comes with your choice of 9 sauces. I chose Bearnaise but there was also peppercorn, horseradish, steak, BBQ and others too many to mention. Not sure which cut of steak my friend had but his was delicious too. As for sides? We had Potato gratin, and \"hen of the woods\" mushrooms which were great. And finally- dessert. The sticky toffee pudding cake with pecan ice cream was the winner of the evening. Absolutely the perfect way to end our evening. \n\nThe manager came over a couple of times throughout our dinner and made us feel welcome and valued. The even better news, is that he told me that they were going to open a BLT in Chicago in the near future. It should be interesting to see how it fares with all the other great steakhouses that are there! \n\nI loved that the live music from the Lobby bar wafted into the restaurant and kept us entertained throughout the night- beckoning us to come back to the bar and linger to awhile. \n\nBLT is not for the \"faint of wallet\". While I didn't see the final bill- I am quite sure that dinner for two with drinks and dessert ran somewhere in the $250 range so not an everyday dinner place. But worth a splurge every now and again. \n\nThe only downside for me was that there is no reciprocal agreement between the bar and the restaurant. You have to close out one tab and cannot carry your drinks forward to the restaurant when you are ready to eat. Seems like there could be an easy fix for that given this is all in a Ritz hotel known for it's service. \n\nFabulous food, great service and a welcoming attitude from all.

Our food was brought out, we were checked on throughout our visit, and given a goodbye as we walked out the door- all with a smile by the gentleman behind the counter.\n\nAs for the food: BF got a 6 piece fried with a side of mac, I opted for the 4 piece rotisserie with a side of veggies, and we added on a hot chick and a thai tea- the latter mostly because since when have I ever been able to get chicken strips and thai tea in the same place? Bizarre but lovely. The drink was out right away and just a smidge less sweet than I am used to. $2 cup is well-priced.\n\nThe chicken arrived hot and tasty: BF surprisingly preferred the grilled while I preferred the panko breading for the fried version. We tried several different sauces including the ranch (nothing interesting), wasabi (nice with just a little kick), honeymustard (light but not my thing), strip sauce (my favorite), and buffalo (my second favorite, dude's preferred dip). BF put it well: he'd come back for the grilled strips tossed in buffalo sauce, but the rest of the menu seemed too similar to Raisin' Cane's for his liking, and he's a huge fan of theirs.\n\nAs for the sides: the mac was super indulgent and better than the mac I've had at more formal or high-end places. Loved that the dish was still gooey and cheesy instead of dried out, which I run into a lot at places that call themselves \"southern\" or boast about being \"homestyle\". Dude, if I made this mac at home, I'd never leave... because I'd weigh 500 pounds. It's good, but definitely only get if you went to the gym that day, there's a lot of guilt involved with that much pasta and cheese.\nThe grilled veggies were a surprise hit with BF, he'd tack those on to his future grilled-with-buffalo purchase.\n\nLastly, the hot chick was oddly again one of my favorite things: a simple fried strip doused in buffalo sauce (sensing a theme?) and placed in a small bun with lettuce and tomato, it's simple and it's delicious. There's  meal option for two of those with a side, and I'd likely consider it in the future.\n\nFinal note about their loyalty program: tracks your purchase spendings by the dollar, when you reach a $60 total you get a free meal.

Before you all shake your head and laugh, I had checked out their menu and figuring that they also have other branches around the world, they must be doing something right.\n\nThe restaurant is located out on N Scottsdale Rd and has ample parking. The interior of the restaurant is big and airy, unlike its London counterpart, which has tables crammed up together. There is a bar area where they carve the big pieces of ice on which the fresh fish is served. The main restaurant area is dominated by the open plan robata grill. As I was dining on my own, I chose to sit at the grill to watch/chat to the friendly chefs and to make friends. There was a good buzz about the place.\n\nI got a shock though when I opened the menu. I had my heart set on having the tasting menu to sample more dishes but the tasting menu was for a minimum of 2 people. Being the USA where the customer is king (please note, all UK restaurant owners!), I decided to ask the server to find out from the kitchen whether I would be able to have the tasting menu on my own as I had come all the way from London. I was so pleased when the server returned with a positive answer.\n\nWell, the generosity of the restaurant knew no bounds. I am sure that they served me the equivalent amount of food for 2 people with double portions of everything. I was starting to panic as the never-ending sea of food kept flowing out of the kitchen - I hate to return uneaten food to the kitchen but there was no way I was going to be able to eat all of it. Fortunately, I made friends with the diners on either side of me and between us, we did manage to eat it all.\n\nHaving had some misgivings about eating sushi in the middle of the desert, I found out from the chefs that all the food is specially flown in, mostly from abroad, so even the London branch would be getting its fish from Japan rather than Billingsgate.\n\nOnce service started, dish after dish just flowed out of the kitchen, all beautifully presented.\n\n1. Butterfish tataki - lovely delicate fish which possibly needed an accent like ginger.\n\n2. Spinach salad with peanut dressing - refreshing.\n\n3. Rock shrimp tempura with chilli mayonnaise. Very light batter enclosing just cooked shrimp.\n\n4. Premium sushi including my favourite melt in your mouth toro. Mmmmmmm.\n\n5. Wagyu gunkan with caviar. My only disappointment of the menu. I think the flavour of the super expensive beef was wasted in this preparation. Was even hard to tell it was beef. I appreciate the expense but perhaps they could do a different preparation.\n\n6. Spicy tuna roll. Lovely.\n\nThen came the robata grilled dishes.\n\n7. Sweet potato. Was a bit sceptical that it would cook enough on the grill but it was lovely and crispy.\n\n8. Black cod. Which Japanese restaurant doesn't have a version of this dish popularised by Nobu? Still wonderful with large flakes of white fish accompanied by that lovely sweet sticky sauce.\n\n9. Lamb chops with Korean spices. Huge meaty chops but moist and tender.\n\n10. Rice pot offered with vegetables or king crab. Had to be the crab though I was ready to explode by this stage! This was something new that I have never seen before. Probably best described like Japanese risotto where the crab was mixed into creamy rice and a generous amount of tobiko added some pops. There was an incredible depth of flavour that I suspect comes from a proper stock.\n\nLast but not least and I'm afraid I may have actually laughed out loud when dessert arrived. It was the most fabulous looking and enormous dessert selection served on a block of ice. I can't actually remember what was on there - my stomach may have been telling my brain to abort at this stage! However, I had a taste of everything and like the rest of the meal, it was divine.\n\nSo top marks to Roka Akor for flexibility and their generosity for feeding me and my 2 impromptu dining partners. I was happy to escape the fate of the exploding man in Monty Python's Meaning of Life sketch ('just a little wafer, monsieur') but it was the quality of the food, not its quantity which captured my stomach's praise.\n\nI was able to chat to the Scandinavian head chef later, who extracted a promise from me to go and try the London branch and let him have my honest opinion. Well, Scottsdale wins, guys! You have a more spacious restaurant, more friendly staff, amazing flexibility in customer service and more generosity with the dishes (London's 'premium' menu sushi selection only included salmon, tuna and yellowtail - no sign of any toro) And to achieve this in the middle of the desert!", "business_id": "bgTB6MgdVQssXhkNJ7qIfw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-03-15", "type": "review"}

Not a Nevada only chain like some others were lead to believe, but a national one. It doesn't carry the name of a Quizno's or Subway's, only its way better and until LV gets an place that is local and convenient, it seems the rest will be flocking here and adding to the already silly lines that occur randomly throughout the week.\n\nMy sandwich of choice is the Full Montagu, a beautiful concoction of turkey, roast beef, lettuce, cheddar and swiss cheeses, tomatoes, and Earl's mustard. It's a classic choice, perhaps their most popular one, and it is delicious any time - whether its hungry and sober or hungover and blacked out. A fun combination is the Turkey Holiday (aka the Thanksgiving dinner), which features turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and gravy.

I can get the connection on my laptop, but it won't load up any pages.....don't know what the problem is, when I land in Vegas or San Diego, it works just fine there.\n\n\n- Car Rental return lanes through the airport is confusing.  I am willing to bet that 9 out of 10 people who try to find the car rental return lane have to attempt it at least 2 or 3 times to figure it out.....the directions and route is crazy confusing.  The rental center itself is convenient, and the process of returning your car is efficient, but driving there is a disaster.\n\n- Food options are limited once you go past security.  Not much going on there.\n\n- Gates have insufficient seating.

I think outside of Vegas, a drink like this one would most likely go for $6 and would probably not exceed $8.\n\nSerendipity's frozen hot chocolate is a good but not special drink even though you are definitely paying a special, premium price.  I think it is good for at least one try, but I think the flavor does not really stand out that much.  There is a Vosges boutique in the Forum Shops and that chocolates boutiques used to serve milkshakes--they were far better in terms of flavor and even a little cheaper than Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate.\n\nNow that Vosges no longer offers those milkshakes, I'm not sure where you can find a great frozen chocolate drink in Vegas, but a less expensive Haagen-Dazs milkshake would probably provide just as satisfying flavor and experience as what you can have at Serendipity (with the exception of the whipped cream).\n\nSerendipity is located in the outside dining area at the front of Caesars Palace.  Caesars Palace offers both complimentary valet and self parking.", "business_id": "Xhg93cMdemu5pAMkDoEdtQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-09-20", "type": "review"}

We browsed the menu and decided on getting a Diavola Pizza (Crushed Tomatoes, Finnochiona (Peppered Salame), Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil.) and a Settebello Pizza (Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Roasted Fennel Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil.)  We planned to split each Pizza in half and share it so we can taste both.\n\nWhen the Pizza arrived, I was pleased to see that it was very similar to the Pizza I had in Napoli.  The first Pizza out was the Settebello.  When I bit into the first slice, I could immediately taste the Fennel Sausage and Mushrooms.....it was sooo good!  The crust is thin and slightly burnt on the bottom, just how I like it.  The ratio of Cheese to Sauce was perfect.  This was a good Pizza Pie.\n\nThe second Pizza to arrive was the Diavola.  When I took the first bite, the Finnochiona & Red Bell Peppers were the first flavors I could taste....yum!  It too was slightly burnt on the crust.  Another great Pizza Pie.\n\nThe service was good as we were only 1 of 3 tables in the entire restaurant.  We were there around 4 pm on a Sunday....I hope it was just the time of day that was the cause of the slow business.  I don't want to see this place close down.\n\nWill I return?

Hawthorn Suites (part of the Hyatt chain) is located just off the strip, tucked between the Tropicana and the San Remo and directly across from the MGM Grand. There's no  casino, no all-you-can-eat buffet, no 24-hour lounge with third rate singers - just spacious and comfortable accommodations a short walk away from all the properties with slot machines and blackjack tables. One and two-bedroom suites, all with a balcony or patio, are available. Each has a fully equipped kitchen (with all appliances, including a microwave, dishwasher, and coffee/tea maker with complimentary coffee provided daily), dining area, and living room (with sleeper sofas) with plenty of room to spread out. Each bedroom has its own bath (with hair dryer). Other amenities include cable TV (equipped with Nintendo and pay-per-view movies), modem/data port connection with high speed Internet access, iron/ironing board, and voicemail. A complimentary newspaper is left at the door. There are laundry facilities on the property. There is a large pool, daily maid service, plenty of parking, an on-site convenience store and ATM, and the front desk is manned 24 hours. The hotel is pet friendly and features both handicapped access and non-smoking rooms. Cribs are available for families with infants. Unlike many of the larger hotels, they permit a Saturday arrival. Rates vary greatly, depending upon season and guest affiliations (AAA, AARP, etc.), but a one-bedroom can be had for as little as $89.00, with a two-bedroom going for $134.00.", "business_id": "n26V6IcG8RiGUm08kXcLxg", "stars": 4, "date": "2005-07-12", "type": "review"}

It truly is a stroke of irony to know that Terrible's is named after someone's gas station company and is among the most terrible in the city.\n\nThe casino is very slot heavy here, with only a handful of blackjack tables, and 1 Roulette / Craps / 3 Car Poker table.

Casino staff is nice, though there seemed to be more cocktail waitresses than personnel.  At some point, it gets downright depressing to be here for longer than a few hours.\n\nBecause the casino property itself is smaller, there are no fancy restaurants or any signs of nightlife here.  They've got one little cafe / diner (Bougainvillea) and a cheap buffet that I don't think I could eat at again even with a gun pointed to my head.\n\nThe suites are small and the standard rooms are even smaller.

I'm giving it 1 and that generous 1 is due to the cheapo prices this place boasts.

Our server suggested 6 or so things to share but there were so many things to try that we ended up ordering 8.  Not to worry, there wasn't a smidge of anything left on our table.  In no particular order we had:\n-Gin and Tonic oysters\n-Chicken Fritters served in a shoe.  A SHOE!!\n-White asparagus with thyme served in a sardine can\n-Lobster salad- very unexpected and fresh\n-Cauliflower with dates and olives- a god must have created this mixture it was so good\n-Scallops in a red sauce\n-Steamed Mussels \n-Grilled chicken\n\nAll were amazing, although I probably would not order the chicken again as it just couldn't stand up to the amazing combination of flavors of the other dishes.\n\nAnd that shoe that the chicken fritters come in was a funny story.  I saw the busser walking around with a shoe on his tray and asked just what was up with that.  He said the chef liked that brand of shoe and that he chose to serve food in it.  As simple as that , and even though neither my friend or l were eating fried or breaded food, we had an order of those darn fritters!\n\nA great night out in a city that has a ton of amazing places to eat.

You also have a lot of similar add-on options like black beans and grilled veggies, and later, an awesome guac.\n\nLike Chipotle, the protein options here are tasty- but I can find a chicken burrito on nearly every corner. I can't find huli huli chicken or kaluah pig very easily at all- and here, both are phenomenally well done!\n\nBut what makes this place really stand out, in addition to the tasty island flavor, is the service- when I walk into a place and am greeted by the owner himself, it means something to me. Chatted with the guy for a bit and he is clearly dedicated to this business and it's success- this is not another place where the owner is MIA and leaves a manager in charge of running things. He's right there, interacting with everyone who walks through the door. Major props.\n\nAnd the food doesn't disappoint! I was offered samples of the pork and chicken when I walked in- both were delicious, but I ultimately went with the kaluah pork salad bowl, lite on the seaweed rice, plus black beans and grilled veggies, both the corn salsa and the tomato/onion salsa, a sprinkle of cheese and cilantro, and a side of guac.\nIt was amazing. The meat is tender, plentiful and flavorful, the veggies are fresh and not overcooked, the corn salsa is mild and adds a good extra punch to the dish, and the tomato-onion salsa adds a tiny bit of heat. Don't be turned off by the \"spicy\" label, it's not bad at all. \n\nAnd the portion size is humongous. I can put away quite a bit of food, but only half of my salad. I used my fork to take additional scoops of guac every few bites, and it really added an extra dimension to the dish- the bright acidity and slight saltiness were great.\n\nIf you look closely, up by the soda dispensers, there are various bottled sauces and salsas to add that extra bit of island flavor to your dish- and they're not just a selection of various bottles. Oh no. They're Braddah's Island Style-brand bottles with what I can only assume is the company's own sauces- a pineapple jalapeno one added a splash of sweetness and spice to mine, but I steered clear of the mango habanero- sounded like a dangerous territory for my tastebuds!\n\nAll in all, I'm very pleased with this place.

Store itself isn't much: the other Euro markets have better selection and organization, and the only thing making this \"Mediterranean\" is their selection of baklava, olives, and olive oil. But all of their products can be found elsewhere in town, and their produce is less than fresh.\nBut the halal butcher is fairly unique: $27 for a giant lamb shank to be turned into a stew? Totally doable here.\n\nDine-in counter has a few basic tables and chairs but most orders seem to be for takeout. As advertised on a banner on building exterior, they have a chicken shwarma sandwich for $4.99. What the banner doesn't tell you is that it's a giant wrap with an amazing garlic sauce. That garlic sauce makes it, and it's what I miss from my favorite Med place in Texas. I'll come back for that, repeatedly!\n\nAnother score on the menu is the beef filet mignon kabobs: priced at a $12 plate for a good portion of tender, flavorful beef on a bed of yellow rice, with sides of marinated veggies and creamy hummus. Hummus was good, and is on the sides menu for about $5/portion along with babaghanoush and tabouli.\n\nCome for the chicken shwarma wrap and the filet, but not much else.

Unfortunately, the sports book here is stuck in time- the majority of TVs seemed dated and the larger screens were not even on. There is a limited number of nice chairs, and a lot of individual TV screens with buttons that do not work and no way to access the expanded channels with the preferred games.\n\nAs a result, BF and I sat apart to watch the games, and were peering up at two lone screens showing the GS game that were probably a good 80 feet away. I could barely make out the scores, let alone follow the plays and determine whether the calls were valid. Not a place to watch a game, at all.\n\nAlso, this is a SPORTS book. Is there any reason whatsoever for the fact that every other screen was showing not a game, but music videos? And old ones, at that: we're talkin' the Cranberries and Bob Marley.

I doused each bit with this Mustard....which made the sandwich edible because the Pastrami was dried out and too chewy.  Also, the crust of the Rye Bread was tough....had a Beef Jerky texture to it.....what?  I've never had Rye Bread like that......maybe it's normal, but not in my book.\n\nI forced myself to finish it because I didn't want my $25 meal (Iced Tea was $3.50 for glass, plus tax and gratuity) to go to waste.

There's a reason you often hear the word \"pinch\" next to \"salt.\" If it's over done, yikes, it's just gross and their blackened coating is like a salt lick. Which was sucha  bummer, because those scallops were cooked to perfection, but after attempting to scrape off the blackening on 4 of them, I finally just gave up. Perhaps the way to go is to just ask for them grilled. I think they would be superb then, but stay away from the salty blackened option.\n\nOther than that minor thing, I really enjoyed our experience here. The waiter was a great sport considering we had two comedians with us and put up with all of our silliness. The only other thing was the check sitch. I guess they don't like to split a check more than 2 ways. Eventually they split ours 3 ways after persisting, so i might suggest asking ahead of time if they can split the bill if you are planning on anymore than two cards.\n\n:)", "business_id": "B8ujMtvvpHyEQ2r_QlAT2w", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-12-14", "type": "review"}

One pizza came first. WTH? Where were the salads? Or the other pizza? The salads showed up a few minutes later and then our server realized that she had forgotten our second pizza. No biggie since we had salads and one pizza to eat. But the service was lackluster with a L.

Even 4 years after its inception, it can still be debated on whether the turmoil that lead to erecting this massive collection of properties was worth it.\n\nThere were a number of issues, which could directly be attributed to timing, bad management, and financial handling that kept delayed construction and its eventual opening in 2009. For instance, 6 people died in the construction of the site, prompting a strike from the workers who were concerned for their safety after working on the project for what was then a non-stop 24 hour schedule. \n\nThen there was the 2008 world recession, which left a virtual hole in the Strip, leading to a major decline in tourism and money for the city. Delays ensued when the Dubai folks decided to sue their joint venture partners MGM for a breach of contract. Let's not forget that after it opened, it failed to land much fanfare for almost two years the rash (pun intended) of sunburning incidents due to the construction of the Vdara reflecting beams from the sun? After initial estimates of 4 billion to complete the project, the subsequent total cost was more than double, at a cool 9 billion dollars.\n\nThere is still The Harmon, a tower that was meant to be a boutique non-gaming resort that has never opened to the public. Halted after realizing there were major construction defects during the building process, it has been OK'd for demolition which is likely to happen later in the year or in 2014.\n\nWhether it was worth 9 billion or not, the general makeup of CityCenter is aesthetically pleasing. The Veer Towers (http://www.yelp.com/biz/veer-towers-las-vegas) are a nice high rise living option on the Strip to those who can afford it. In all of its sunburning glory, the Vdara (http://www.yelp.com/biz/vdara-las-vegas-2) is a pretty non-gaming hotel and the Mandarin Oriental (http://www.yelp.com/biz/mandarin-oriental-las-vegas-las-vegas) is one of the nicest resorts in the United States, let alone Las Vegas. There are eyeballs widening from all corners for Crystals (http://www.yelp.com/biz/crystals-at-citycenter-las-vegas), a mall where no limit credit cards can be happily utilized. The most well known property through the thick of it all is the ARIA (http://www.yelp.com/biz/aria-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas), if not one of the better casino hotels on the south Strip, if not among the most scintillating.\n\nThe CityCenter, in spite of its initial problems, provides all visitors to the Strip luxurious options to spend their time in the City of Sin. It brings out a new dimension architecturally, a flashy range of eateries, venues, and entertainment, and will hopefully live up to all the hype it has built up for itself for the better part of the last decade.", "business_id": "BDv2cNhoRXqqrNaKSVuZbQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-10-25", "type": "review"}

This is not the Bellagio, this is not the Wynn, so scale back your expectations accordingly.\n\nThat being said, it is surprisingly large and when I went on a weekend for dinner just after 5PM, the wait was less than 5 minutes. Maybe some consider that a bad sign, but as we dined business picked up.\n\nCame using a BOGO Groupon- all you can eat and all you can drink for two for $46. Not bad at all. Pricing was not available online to see what locals prices were or which deal was better, but gave it a shot. The $11.50 extra for all you can drink option is not something I'd pay to add on in the future- BF and I each had two drinks (beer and champagne, respectively) and did not feel it was worth it.\n\nFood is divided up by cuisine style:\nSeafood- snow crab legs and shrimp plentiful, but disappointed with sushi. Very little was out and it was all dry and falling apart as if it was left over from lunch or the day before. Was never restocked during our visit. Only consisted of simple cucumber, salmon and california rolls. Avocado in the CA roll was brown, ew. You'd think with crab and shrimp available, there would be a better selection.\n\nSalad- loved the wedge salads available, haven't seen that many places!\nSoups- only chicken noodle and tortilla were available, didn't look appetizing.\n\nItalian- pastas all looked as if they'd been sitting out, but meatball was tasty. I'm mostly avoiding carbs, so I did not really spend much time in this area.\n\nChinese- very generic, did not have anything here.\n\nBarbecue- BF enjoyed the prime rib, yukon gold mashed potatoes were delicious, barbecue pork shank was tasty! Despite signage for sliders, only fried chicken kept being put out. It was tasty but not my thing.\n\nDessert- Tons of cupcakes. Not sure why they're so large, seems wasteful as most people are only taking a bite or two and trying other flavors. Someone probably needs to rethink this.\n\nMid-Eastern- grilled veggies, chicken and lamb were all good, tabouli and naan flavorful, lamb tagine was surprisingly true to flavor.\n\nMexican- Like the Italian area, disappointing. All food was very basic and appeared to have been sitting out.\n\nSalad- lots of cheeses, breads, and spreads available here. Opted for a lot of fresh fruit and got a wedge of brie with some fruity bread, very tasty.", "business_id": "SLyacGZuMUKqrQJEooSkjw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-01-27", "type": "review"}

To the other end - the true risk taker of the evening came with dessert as the nearly unpalatably bitter grapefruit, champagne, and pepper cocktail was served front and center completely overwhelming the palate only to be followed by five additional sweets stimulating the rest of the palate and completing the vision.\n\nCertainly not a restaurant or meal for those happy to dine at a buffet in order to get back to the craps table Twist is a place to sit, think, enjoy the scenery and the service, and embrace the chef's vision - it is like no other place in Vegas, and all-in it remains my favorite restaurant in the city.", "business_id": "uYKwS-biARKgBkk5rY_PaQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-05-13", "type": "review"}

Staff was super friendly, from the servers to the owner, who went out of his way to make us feel welcome, ask for feedback, and allow us to sample menu items.\n\nHighlight of the menu is the jalapeno fries: tempura-fried jalapeno strips with a tabasco-spiked ranch dressing. The light batter mellows out the spice of the peppers, and has a similar effect when used on the fried pickles.\n\nReally came for the burgers, which are stuffed and topped with additional cheeses, jalapenos, and bacon, in a few different varieties. Unfortunately, I found that the burgers didn't quite live up to my expectations: thy were a bit too overloaded and difficult to eat, buns fell apart, and the plethora of gourmet toppings/stuffings PLUS the traditional burger veggies was just too much. \nAs for the burgers themselves, the Jalapeno Popper one outranked the Big Mess burger for our group, but we were in agreement that the patties were overcooked.\nPartially accepting some blame myself, as our burgers were taken to-go, and the steam trapped in the box likely contributed to the buns falling apart. \nGood flavors and good value for price though: $11/each.\n\nWill come back for appetizers and SHUFFLEBOARD (anyone want to try to beat me?), and likely to watch a few games.

Tao was also featured on the Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate where Duff Goldman selected their satay of Chilean sea bass as his favorite thing in Las Vegas.\n\nTao is located in The Venetian and it is a big spot with a dark decor (very loud as well).

We did have a fixed party menu so maybe more freshly prepared dishes would have stood out more though the flavors were not exciting or memorable.\n\nService was fine.

Despite the quality of the food, the portions were incredibly dainty making Fleur feel quite overpriced.\n\nFor lunch, Fleur works better though (at least in terms of value).  There is a mix of small plates so you can get a small taste of what Fleur cooks up at dinner.  There are also more substantial lunch plates--sandwiches and salads but also entrees like steak frites and salmon.\n\nI started with the burrata salad--something I would expect to see on the dinner menu and it was actually a substantial starter.  There was a generous portion of burrata, which was very creamy.  The burrata sat on some good, juicy and sweet heirloom tomatoes.  The burrata was topped with tomato pearls.\n\nThere was also olive oil powder and basil powder.  The basil powder had a stronger flavor, but the olive oil powder had a more memorable texture as it turned to almost cream upon tasting it.\n\nEverything was garnished with a really good balsamic--a very deep and rich flavor.  There was also a side of bread, which was just okay--they probably should have toasted it.\n\nFor my entree, I went with the steak frites, which included a very generous portion of hanger steak.  There were two pieces of steak.  One was cooked very nicely.  It was incredibly tender and also quite juicy.  The even cooking of the steak (maybe it was sous vide) was very impressive.  There was also a good outside sear.\n\nThe other piece of steak was not as good (maybe the unevenness of temperature had to with how the pieces were quite different in size).  The steak was okay, but it was not as tender and a little dry in parts.\n\nThe steak had a good flavor; I still would have preferred more seasoning because the sauce was too light in flavor to add much.  With steak frites, I like a richer bordelaise like the one at Lucques (Los Angeles).\n\nThe herb garlic frites were nice and crisp.  The frites were a little uneven in seasoning as some frites had more of a garlic flavor, which was nice.\n\nThey had several desserts, but I didn't think much sounded exciting.  I ended up opting for the almond panna cotta.  The panna cotta was topped with strawberry citrus soup and then garnished with blackberries, streusel, and kalamansi blackberry sorbet.  The panna cotta had a great consistency.  It was creamy, smooth and light.\n\nThere was not much of an almond flavor while there was an overabundance of strawberry citrus soup.  The strawberry soup kind of overpowered the panna cotta.\n\nI liked the streusel, which was buttery and crisp.  The kalamansi blackberry sorbet was also good--not icy and very cool and refreshing.\n\nService was very good.  My server was personable and polite.  He was also very attentive and intuitive even though he had to service many tables.  The hostess was nice too (and attractive if that is important to you).\n\nAs mentioned, prices are not too bad.  Almost everything was priced under $20 and portions were more than generous on a few plates.\n\nFor lunch, only the cafe is open.  While the decor is nice and contemporary, it is close to the casino so you have to deal with casino noise; the cigarette smoke also wafts over a little bit, which is unfortunate.\n\nFor dinner, the main dining room is much nicer.  The room is very contemporary, but it is also very warm (great use of warm colors) and inviting.  It is also farther back in the restaurant, which makes it feel like a nice and relaxing retreat from Vegas.\n\nThe food at Fleur is good for both lunch and dinner, but lunch is much more affordable.  There are not many notable upscale places open for lunch in Vegas so it is nice to have an option like Fleur available.\n\nFleur is located in Mandalay Bay and like many casinos, Mandalay Bay has its own free parking structure.  The structure leads right to Fleur's entrance.", "business_id": "N50HceZf1595UtU867u4uQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-02", "type": "review"}

There was a ninety-minute wait at the Hash House a Go Go and not even a bench to sit around and wait. Damn that Rachael Ray. Alas, I went to the Yelp app on my iPhone and found a nearby breakfast eatery that was also averaging around four stars. It literally took us about three minutes to get to Jamm's and big surprise...it's in a strip mall, our third off-the-Strip place that was in a strip mall. We noticed the place was abuzz with customers but not nearly to the level of the Hash House. There was a fifteen-minute wait here, and the diners were not nearly as fashionably attired. \n\nIt's a modest operation, the type that has a cheery hostess and cartoon murals on the walls. The menu is pretty robust, but unlike the nearby Egg & I, there was a lot more thought and care in the execution of the dishes. Jamie W. ordered the $8.45 Reuben Omelet, which was full of strands of corned beef and mounds of sauerkraut. There was also a generous slab of Swiss cheese melted on top and a side of crispy hashed browns (see photo). I went for a similar dish, the $8.50 Irish Skillet, which had the same corned beef accompanied by diced onions, green peppers and potatoes, all mixed into scrambled eggs and melted cheddar cheese (see photo). It was a mess of high-cholesterol goodness well put together. Tasty too. \n\nJamie, in a moment of insanity laced with homesickness for his Midwestern roots, also ordered the $5.25 full order of Biscuits and Country Gravy, which was a gloppy pool on a plate (see photo). I won't deny it wasn't good in a deep Southern kitchen kind of way with the biscuits sopping up all that gravy, though I attempted to re-purpose it as an extra topping for my skillet breakfast. Bloated was the way we both felt afterward but also sated. Needless to say, I also noticed they decorated the restroom stall with the same cartoon murals. Somebody must have had time on their hands. By the way, the waitress was also cheery, chatty and about nineteen. She was refilling my coffee cup with unadulterated pleasure. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...country breakfasts with deli twists, well executed with simple ingredients \nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...kitchen cozy with Fingerhut touches \nSERVICE - 4 stars...cheery thy name is Jamm \nTOTAL - 4 stars...good diner-style eats can be found in a strip mall", "business_id": "co0vxQ8ecXiBy2sGDeHi8A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-24", "type": "review"}

IT'S BRITNEY IN VEGA$ B*TCH!!!\n\nFor my Yelp review #3200, I have decided to finally \"yelp\" the Britney: Piece of Me show, which is Britney Spears' residency concert at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas. This review will focus on going as a VIP to Britney's show.\n\nI HAVE BEEN A DIEHARD BRITNEY SPEARS FAN SINCE 1999! I've attended several Britney concerts over the years and have enjoyed myself at each concert.\nWhen Britney Spears announced in 2013 that she was doing a two year residency in Las Vegas, I knew immediately that I MUST GO SEE BRITNEY IN VEGAS!!! The theater inside Planet Hollywood (The Axis) was remodeled just for the Britney: Piece of Me concert.  I went online back in December 2013 when tickets to her shows went on sale. Also, one of my longtime goals was to meet Britney Spears in person. MEET & GREET PACKAGES WERE $2,525. My jaw dropped at the price! This was probably my only sure chance that I will get to meet Britney Spears. \n\nI put my head down for 10 minutes, then calmly went online constantly thinking YOLO (You Only Live Once), picked a good date in May, and went ahead and purchased the Britney Spears Meet & Greet Package for $2,525 plus fees and optional event insurance. This package included a front row seat above the VIP tables, backstage tour, meet & greet & photo with Britney, autographed Britney poster, VIP laminate,  dedicated VIP check-in counter, and dedicated escort for VIP purchasers into the venue.  I immediately booked travel plans to Las Vegas afterwards. I received emails from Caesars Entertainment (owns Planet Hollywood) with reminders, hotel offers, and logistical updates (when and where to be on the night of the show). \n\nVIP PRESHOW ACTIVITIES: The VIP Meet & Greet ticket holders (around 20 folks) including myself gathered near the box office at our specified time, a few hours before show time and doors open to public. Staff escorted us into the venue. We were given instructions on how to conduct ourselves during the backstage tour including all cameras and cellphones must be turned off (no pictures were allowed of anything behind the scenes) and no touching of props & equipment (except for one wooden prop). Felicia Culotta (backstage tour director/former assistant for Britney) was our backstage tour guide with security staff behind our group. On the tour, we got to see the backstage area, props, lighting and sound equipment, Britney's upstairs dressing room (saw various costumes), and met some of the staff behind the scenes. We got to see the small costume changing areas on the stage (not visible to the audience). Lynne (Britney's mom) with Britney's two sons were present backstage and waved to us. Felicia did a great job explaining details and facts about the Britney - Piece of Me concert using a flipbook with notes. There is no upper level seating inside The Axis since the upper section is filled up with lighting equipment.  \n\nAfter the tour was done, our group was escorted to the front lobby, where we posed with a few of Britney's costumes from her music videos (behind glass cases), picked up our VIP merchandise (laminate/signed poster), and enjoyed crowd free shopping at the merchandise tables. Our VIP group met up again with Felicia (30 minutes later) and we were escorted outside to the backstage door (secured area), where we lined up to head inside to get our individual photo-ops (by a professional photographer) with Britney. The M&G and photo with Britney went superfast, not enough time to speak, just take the picture with Brit and exit outside and back inside again into the lobby. It was sooo awkward!\n\nCONCERT:  I had a front & center seat (Sec 103 Row A Seat 15 above the VIP tables) with a great view and directly in front of the center of the catwalk/stage. The catwalk extends out from the main stage with standing crowds on each side to the VIP tables in front. This 90 minute show showcased many of her greatest hits including Womanizer, 3, Baby One More Time, Oops!... I Did It Again, Me Against The Music, Piece of Me, Scream & Shout (BRING THE ACTION!), I'm A Slave 4 U, Circus, Toxic, Stronger, (You Drive Me) Crazy, Work B$tch, and others.  I enjoyed the high energy of the show including the lighting, special effects (fire, confetti, lasers, fog), various props, dancers & choreography, various costumes, and the music of course. Britney danced the night away with lots of energy, sounded great (with the help of back tracks) and looked fabulous in each outfit and costume throughout the entire show. \n\nAfter the show, I picked up my M&G photo with Britney (in a souvenir photo holder) from Felicia and the digital file of the photo on a flash drive.\n \nWhat an amazing and very entertaining show! I enjoyed it from start to finish! The Axis was a great theater to showcase Britney Spears, not a bad seat in the house. I finally got to meet one of my all-time favorite pop stars too! This show was worth it for a DIEHARD BRITNEY SPEARS FAN!! YOLO!", "business_id": "CycoHGY_dcTD8YcylyYO-w", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-28", "type": "review"}

We had intentions of going to another club afterwards, but the love at Tao was too strong.  It grabbed onto us and didn't let us go.\n\nFirst off, I strongly encourage you to reserve a table on a weekend.  You'll save yourself the torment of waiting hours in line.  When we came up the escalator we saw hundreds of people in line for Tao.  I've haven't seen a line that long since I was at Disney World.  Of course, we didn't have to wait in line.\n\nOnce we established ourselves, we were led into the club immediately.  Even ahead of those who had tables.  This is where my boys' connection comes in.  It's the type of connection that most may never have, but still, I highly advise bottle service.\n\nOur table is in the center of club, overlooking the dance floor and the wannabee go-go dancers aka drunk chicks with no beat.

Sitting down in the bar area I was instantly glad I'd made a reservation - possibly the busiest restaurant I saw during my whole trip to Vegas the average wait for a party of 2 was 30 minutes!  After approximately 5 minutes I was led to my table - a small two-top at the edge of the main dining room and thankfully somewhat isolated by the intensely loud interior of the restaurant.  Greeted by my seemingly overworked server I was asked if I wanted wine and when I declined she simply disappeared for approximately ten minutes, a theme of absence that would recur frequently during the meal.\n \nEventually returning to take my order and fill my water glass I had spent plenty of time browsing the unique Cali-French cuisine of Chef Eric Lhuillier and when I asked regarding the foie gras on the dinner menu I was told that the chef would be glad to prepare it - placing my orders I was left to wait - again for an excessive amount of time. Thankfully in my server's absence another young man took the onus to attend to my water glass while another well dressed server brought me a couple of fantastic dinner rolls.  Served with small chunks of cold and unsalted butter the rolls were served piping hot from the oven and had a great ratio of crusty salted exterior to soft and airy interior - they were actually so buttery sweet that adding the table butter was entirely unnecessary.  Being sure not to overfill like the prior day I limited myself to only two pieces of bread and plenty of water while I waited.\n \nArriving literally after the table across from myself had ordered, eaten, paid and departed, my first dish was indeed my special request from the dinner menu - and while there was nothing special about the service at this meal, the dish continued a theme of quite exceptional food that was started by the rolls.  Described as \"Chaud froid of seared foie gras - Pickled pineapple and heirloom radishes\" the dish was actually presented as a large pile of artisan greens and shredded radishes with great snap and pieces of duck confit intermixed over the top of two medium sized lobes of warm seared foie atop a chunk of incredibly tart yet savory pineapple.  While clearly following a formula of balancing the unctuous foie with the sweet components of fruit and adding greens for texture I actually loved this preparation for the pickled pineapple and the manner in which the acid mingled with the foie.  The foie itself, while good, notably did have a couple of small veins that clearly would not have \"made the cut\" at a higher end restaurant - regardless, for an item not regularly prepared at lunch it was quite nice.\n \nFinishing my foie the plate was left on the table for some time (the table across from me still sat uncleaned as well) before my main course arrived - and even after delivery of my dish the empty plate remained.  Service issues aside, the food once again impressed - this time a classic Croque Monsieur served with crispy garlic frites and a small salad with oil and vinegar.  Not usually a fan of fries I will say these were superb - the best I'd had since those at Bouchon with their Croque, actually.  Served with gruyere and cr\u00e8me fraiche as opposed to the more traditional Mornay or Bechamel sauce I have to admit I liked the \"tang\" from the creme and the combination of the buttery brioche, savory cheese, and well prepared ham made for an excellent sandwich - not as good as some, but vastly better than others - and something \"different\" than the norm.\n \nHappy with the food thus far I knew dessert was a must - it was just a matter of deciding on one.  With balsamic strawberries, apple tart tatin, and souffle there were so many options - but clearly the bread pudding stated to be Chef Splichal's signature was the obvious choice.  Beginning with a buttery and rich croissant the dish was bound with a thick vanilla custard and studded with rich chunks of dark chocolate forming pockets within the admixture.  Delicious on its own the square of cake-like pudding was topped with a sweet strawberry and accompanied by a small vessel of buttery bourbon creme that only served to enhance the sweetness of the dish while accenting the subtle notes of the chocolate and vanilla expertly.  While not as \"fancy\" as a souffle, definitely a worthy \"signature\" dessert.\n \nFinishing another glass of water I paid the bill - nearly $50 for lunch - and left a modest tip.

Perfectly formed with the toothpick through the center of each quartered sandwich, piled high with good tomato, lettuce, mayo, bacon and sliced turkey.

We ordered:\n\nPad Thai Tofu, $13\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-thai-las-vegas?select=2MDRNsUbJhq1-6P5SzQS6w#2MDRNsUbJhq1-6P5SzQS6w\n\nPad See Ew, $13\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-thai-las-vegas?select=jwQ2r-YOmMef6Mn9yISnkQ#jwQ2r-YOmMef6Mn9yISnkQ\n\nThe food came out shortly after we ordered it and we dug into our dishes.  They were very good!  I had the Pad Thai and it had the right combination of sweet and spicy flavors...and they cooked the Tofu just how I ordered it, a little crispy.  Believe it or not, many Thai restaurants can't get that right.  The Better Half enjoyed her Pad See Ew.\n\nOur server and the hostess who sat us were very friendly and offered warm smiles despite being very busy with many demanding customers.\n\nThe only small complaints I have is that the seating in the front room is kind of tight.  We could easily hear the conversations of the tables next to us and the elbow room was less than ideal.  I felt like we had to whisper so that they couldn't hear our conversation.  Also, parking is a bit of a challenge.  You'll have to park at a nearby parking garage or casino and walk here....which isn't too much of a problem if this area is your destination for the evening.\n\nOverall, great restaurant.

Mr. Flay's west coast version was a dream realized only 5 years ago and being situated in a place like Caesars Palace seems ideal.  After all, being the predominant cuisine is Southwest, what better location (aside from Arizona / New Mexico) than Las Vegas?\n\nWhat is strange to me is that the prices are significantly higher in Las Vegas than the New York location.  A slab of fish of any type could be had for $2-3 less and this includes most of the other appetizers / entrees.  I have no problem paying more for better food, but this does not trump anything that could be had in New York.\n\nThe restaurant itself is gorgeous.  A great mix of vibrant colors surround the dining area, with a contemporary feel with an elegant twist.  The funky shapes accompanied by the eclectic decor, which really pounces on the New American theme, while retaining a Southwest element in the food.  I'd give the nod to Las Vegas over New York for ambiance and the overall interior look, however, I expect this since this location is significantly newer.\n\nService is fantastic.  Our waiters were extremely knowledgeable in the food and were able to make excellent recommendations that were enough to impress our guests.  The menus change often and often times it is completely different than anything offered in New York or the Bahamas.\n\nOn a whole Mesa Grill is a real decent place to catch a great meal for business and pleasure.  Most of my business meetings have been during their lunch hour, which I prefer over dinner.

In fact, it is reportedly larger than the Sands Exhibition Center, and that is pretty large.\n \nNeither are as large as the Las Vegas Convention Center, where they have shows like the Consumer Electronics Show, Comdex or the National Association of Broadcasters, which bring in over 100,000 visitors.  \n\nBut for the next tier down in show sizes, the Mandalay Bay can handle it. It is connected to the Mandalay Bay hotel, if you walk past restaurant row and out toward the Shark Reef it is just beyond there. Since the Mandalay Bay is also connected to the next door Luxor, which also is connected to the Excaliber, and on the south side, you have the higher end THE Hotel and 4 Seasons, there is enough accommodations nearby to handle show vendors and attendees. \n\nTHe Mandalay Bay event center is on 2 floors, so it can be broken up to accommodate smaller shows concurrently. There are large escalators to the top floor as well as elevators. There is a FEDEX next to the bottom floor, which is great for show shipments in and out, although most shows are professional managed by Greyhound Exhibition Services, or whatever they call themselves now.

Whether you are going to a fine dining restaurant or a cafe charging fine dining entree prices, chances are you are going to leave the restaurant feeling like you did not get much for your money.  Off The Strip though you will find more local spots and more bang for your buck in good quality and not outrageously pricey restaurants like Lotus of Siam (some may find Lotus of Siam pricey, but it is nothing like the Vegas fine dining spots charging sometimes twice as much as what that restaurant would cost in Los Angeles or other cities).\n\nFirefly is off The Strip and it is a local spot.  It is a longstanding tapas restaurant with a huge following and maybe even a bigger menu.  With the big menu, it is not surprising that some dishes shine while others underwhelm.  Here is the rundown:\n\n(Anchovy toasts with avocado) I liked these toasts.  It was nice having the flavorful anchovy as well as the creaminess from the fresh avocado.\n\n(Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese and smoked almond, red wine reduction) The bacon was crispy and the date was sweet and I liked the blue cheese.  The crunchy almond was kind of odd and I did not like the red wine reduction--unnecessary and it kind of made the bacon wrapped dates overly sugary and soggy if you did not pluck the bacon wrapped dates out of the dish as soon as they came out.\n\n(Camarones a la diabla, shrimp, sweet and spicy sauce, grilled bread) The shrimp was nicely cooked and plump and the sauce had a good amount of heat (a little too BBQ sauce-like though)\n\n(Artichoke toasts, aioli, basil, pepper) The artichoke hearts were good--not as good as the anchovy toasts but still satisfying.\n\n(Heirloom tomatoes, burrata, butter lettuce, basil, balsamic vinaigrette) The heirloom tomatoes were surprisingly juicy for not being in season and the burrata was very creamy (almost as good as the more expensive burrata at Mario Batali's B&B Ristorante in The Venetian / Palazzo).  Unfortunately, the butter lettuce was drenched in balsamic, which made this good green into nothing more than decorative garnish for the plate.\n\n(Empanada with pork, red pepper cream cheese and aioli) I am not familiar with empanadas, but I thought these were good.  They have several other types of empanadas available.\n\n(Padron Peppers) These flash-fried peppers had a nice light outside skin and some good heat.  They would be a nice addition to many dishes.\n\n(Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms) A surprising amount of heat.\n\n(Albondigas, meatballs in a sherry and tomato sauce with parmesan) These meatballs were average stuff in a simple tomato sauce.  I would have preferred freshly grated parmesan to the melted parmesan cheese here (which felt like it had been melted a long time ago and had been sitting around for a while).\n\n(Camarones al ajillo, shrimp, lemon and garlic butter sauce) The shrimp were fine, but I thought the lemon, butter and scampi-like sauce was just okay.  Still, it was not too heavy or oily (I think many would like it).\n\n(Steak and mushroom skewers, filet, roasted garlic cream sauce) I thought these were average; the meat was a tad dry.\n\n(Fried calamari) Standard calamari.\n\nDesserts were satisfying.  The caramel flan had a good flavor and the right texture and while the ice cream did not have an incredibly creamy consistency, the portion was generous and the flavors were pretty good (chocolate, vanilla, pistachio).  The chocolate tres leches cake definitely had the expected moistness of a tres leches cake as well as a light chocolate flavor.\n\nPrices were reasonable.  The food was decent and you do not have to pay the outrageous prices that you have to pay on The Strip.\n\nService was poor.  The staff was pleasant and the food came out at a quick pace, but the staff was not attentive.  After putting in our order, the staff was pretty non-existent so getting drinks and water glasses refilled and receiving the bill took way too long.\n\nFirefly has a dark and loud atmosphere.\n\nFirefly is a good spot if you want a decent meal in Las Vegas but do not want to pay the typical outrageous Vegas prices.  It reminds me a lot of Long Beach's Cafe Sevilla in terms of menu choices and the quality of the food (though that Long Beach restaurant has much better service).\n\nFirefly has its own parking lot (I believe it might be valet parking though).", "business_id": "IyCwqORkMSmK4mAgAFHgnA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-01-12", "type": "review"}

I did have a privacy sign up for a while. However, I did press the request for housekeeping services before I left the room for the day, which was well before 1PM.  When I returned, the room had not been made-up.  Toilet paper hadn't been replenished after the 2nd or 3rd time that I had requested the room to be turned down. I was disappointed. \n\nDisappointed and upset, I was forced to use the restrooms closest to SWIM, nearing the self-parking lot. I was unhappy to have to use that restroom when I was hoping to enjoy the amenities in my own hotel room. Shortly after finding that my room hadnt been turned down and items hadn't been switched out, replenished, etc, I left the room for several more hours.  \n\nOnce I returned, the room (at about 11pm) had finally been turned down.  I was upset that it took so long. I was also very disappointed to find that when I checked out on Monday, that the front desk associate that I spoke with didn't seem to care too much that I was unhappy. I did explain to her that I did understand and know that it had been very busy this past weekend and so housekeeping may have had more rooms than normal to take care of.  I was trying to be understanding. \n\nAnyway, as I was checking out, she didn't seem too worried about it. She seemed to have the attitude like oh well, you're checking out so it doesn't matter anymore. She did suggest that in the future that I could call again for housekeeping services if they were necessary.  I explained to her that I had called again for services, but I still didn't like that I had to wait so long for towels, robes, blankets, mats to be replaced, toilet paper to be replenished, etc.  \n\nI made my reservations at the Encore Hotel Resort and Casino several months in advanced. I was SO excited as I would be visiting to celebrate my birthday.  I thought, somehow, that I would have an absolutely exciting and pampering experience at the Encore, considering it is ranked as one of the top hotels in Vegas. Honestly, I was very disappointed. \n\nI was also disappointed with the room service-in room dining services.  I loved that they had a variety of foods available, and many different types of food as well. There wasn't just a breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert menu.  There was also an Asian menu.  I thought that was pretty awesome. I called for in-room dining at about 8AM.  My phone call was answered pretty promptly.  The person on the other end of the line was nice enough but not exceptionally happy sounding, or friendly. Anyways, I placed my order. She repeated it back to me. When it arrived, it was incorrect. WOW! That was pretty bad. I felt horrible. My husband had to wait another 20+ minutes to receive his breakfast pastry. That wasn't real cool. \n\nReally, my expectations weren't met and I'd love to return in the future. I can only hope that Encore-Wynn will help to make my next experience exceptional, or do something to change my opinion.\n\nAs guests check in, I may suggest having one single line. That way, each person will wait an average time rather than some waiting for 2 seconds and others for 20+ minutes.  I know that the hotel sees a lot of people in a single day. However, try to greet them by name when checking them in and out. Check their ID and at the same time, try to notice their birthday or where they've travelled from and try to talk to them a little bit about something that you have in common with them. Develop rapport. I think that the staff should provide services that are a bit more personalized. Like I said, I know it will be a difficult task but I think guests would appreciate it!\n\nThe small things became a huge deal to me. \n- toilet paper not replenished\n- toiletries not replenished\n- house keeping services not completed in a timely manner\n- drink service pool-side was EXTREMELY slow (wait time = 40min)\n\nI will gladly tell friends and other Vegas visitors that the Encore is a beautiful hotel. However, I cannot tell them in full confidence that I absolutely loved my experience there or that the services provided to me were beyond my expectations.  I really was disappointed.\n\nI had made several calls to the hotel prior to my arrival, weeks and days ahead.  I did explain that my husband was going to accompany me on this trip and that I did want him to be listed on our room. He hadn't been listed and therefore, it took a while longer to add him to my room. Also, I had requested information about the deposit that needed to be left for the room for any incidentals. It hadn't been explained to me that it was going to be $150-200 per night/day.  It had been told to me that it would be $200 - 250 total.  It wasn't a big deal but I did leave my higher limit credit card at home for this purpose. \n\nI expected a friendlier attitude when I visited the pool. I expected the server to be more considerate of the time that they took to deliver drinks to guests.

While in Madison this week- I had a chance to experience what everyone told me was the \"best restaurant in the city\".  In my opinion- it was good, not great and the service needs work.\n\nHarvest has a great location right across from the Capitol within walking distance of the downtown hotels.  It's store front simplicity must surprise a lot of people as the night we were there- there were no less than 5 tables that got seated, looked at the menu, apologized and then walked out.  \n\nIt's my belief that the name \"Harvest\" makes people think its some type of an organic sandwich shop when instead it is a white table cloth dining experience with a menu that includes a 6 course \"tasting\" paired with wines or a more traditional menu.\n\nThe food is good.  The chef sent out a \"muse\" of lettuce soup.  Yep- I said lettuce and that is what is tasted like.  Wasn't crazy about it, but half the fun of eating out is trying new things.  We ordered a variety of first courses from the tuna tartar (very good) to the duck prosciutto (good) to the Caesar wrap (not so good, yet it was the server's recommendation- very strange)  The Caesar wrap was like  small bits of rolled pastry around lettuce served with an anchovy on top and some sauce.  Not the best thing on the menu.\n\nThe main courses were very good.  We had the halibut, the hamachi (covered in foam and served with fava beans) and the crawfish lasagna made with spinach noodles.  For dessert we split the berry crumble (very sour) but good.\n\nAs for the service- it was nonexistent.  In fact- I might suggest that our server get a new career for herself.  She was unpersonable, didn't know the menu and seemed to always be a beat off.  We got more help from the busgirl who seemed very eager to help us out.  Very strange for a restaurant of that caliber.\n\nReasonably priced (at least by Chicago standards) the 6 course tasting menu was only $55 and the accompanying wines were another $25.  On the regular menu, the average entree was about $25.\n\nSo, bottom line?  It was good food, served in a very nice downtown location.

His came out first, and it was just right- large portion for the price ($6.50), flavors were spot on and it was definitely comfort food. He inhaled the dish. My broth was rich and delish, the chashu pork plentiful and flavorful, and the bamboo, nori, and egg really complemented one another. Noodles were plentiful and nicely chewy, but slightly thinner than expected, given that someone told me they were thick? Guess we have different expectations.\n\nThat being said, my pork was cold and I was bummed to see only half of an egg rather than a whole, and it was  overcooked, too. The egg is usually my favorite part, and my favorite ramen place in CA was known for getting the eggs perfect, so maybe I got spoiled by that. Overall, very good- especially the broth!, but there is room for improvement in the little details.\n\nEDIT: have returned for both the spicy ramen and the nori ramen.

Selecting two they were packed into a pretty plastic container and I went to meet my friend.  Offering my pal his selection he told me he had just finished dinner with his wife and was stuffed - but he did try a bite of each.\n\nStarting first with the Tiramisu - not French, but a must almost anywhere I see it - the dish was served fancifully in a plexi-glass square.  Layers of vanilla mascarpone, rum soaked lady fingers, cream, and dusted with cocoa and a bit of chocolate drizzle the dish actually hid a surprise - a core of Raspberry.  While my sister would have been greatly upset by this unannounced guest I have to admit I liked the manner in which the fruity sweetness balanced the dark cocoa tones and heavy rum.\n\nThe second dish, one of Payard's signatures, was vastly more impressive than the tiramisu - it was called Louvre.  Featuring \"Chocolate mousse and hazelnut mousse with a hazelnut dacquoise\" and topped with a thick 72% dark chocolate shell I can only compare this dish to one thing (something that doesn't do it a bit of justice,) a nutella version of a peanut butter cup.  With the gelatinous shell giving way to a milk chocolate mousse, then hazelnut mousse, then a hazelnut cookie...a beautiful blending of textures, tastes, and not heavy at all.\n\nAll said, Raku with tax and tip, a cab ride, coffee, and two pastries from Payard cost me less than Colors of Caviar would cost a la carte at Guy Savoy - sure \"Colors\" has vastly more ingredient cost, but that just goes to show that for the discerning foodie you can indeed do some fine dining in Vegas without totally breaking the bank.

Having garnered national attention after a visit from David Chang and subsequently releasing a cookbook appropriately titled \"Art of Living According to Joe Beef\" I knew it would be my kind of place - I just hoped the chalkboard menu could appease the picky palates of my mother and aunt.\n\nThe Space:  It's a bar - it is tight, it is cramped, it is full of odds n' ends, nick-nacks, trinkets, and even the bathroom is used for storage space.  Apparently only originally 35 seats and subsequently expanded to 70 the stools/chairs are hard and they seat you where they can - in our case at a \"3-top\" booth in the window.  Really, it's pretty awesome, but when it is full it is Loud with a capital L.\n\nThe Service:  Is \"hipster formal\" a service style?  It is now.  Much like the folks at Publican in Chicago or the Chang spots in New York these waiters, decked out in plaid and 5 o'clock shadow know the menu, the preparations, and the chef's vision without hesitation.  Recommendations flow freely, cautionary tales of \"ordering too much\" are given (and ignored,) and although his accent was thick our server's English was flawless - a must on the all-French Chalkboard menu.  \n\nCornflake Eel Nuggets with BBQ, Mustard, Tartar:  As anticipated, my aunt had a lot of difficulty with the appetizer portion of menu but wanting to make sure we experienced the best of what Joe Beef had to offer I took the liberty of ordering the first round for the table; three items with this as the centerpiece.  Served as a half-dozen, intense and creamy with that unctuous undertone that few things save for eel can offer, this should definitely be a must order for anyone making the visit.  Sweet without being sweetened, fatty without being 'greasy', and particularly excellent with the barbeque sauce - with the ladies unwilling to try I gladly ate all six.\n\nParfait de Foie Gras, Cherry Brioche, Truffles:  3.5 ounces of creamy duck liver whipped with black truffles served beneath a piping hot piece of buttery brioche loaded with maraschino cherries; it was every bit as good as it sounds and although I had to wait for a second piece of brioche I was glad to do so.  Like most things at Joe Beef this was probably best shared-but it wasn't.\n\nFoie Gras Double Down:  The second half of my main course was probably Joe Beef's most famous item and clearly poking fun at KFC's abomination of a sandwich Joe Beef takes the concept to a whole different level by replacing chicken with two thick slices of duck foie gras that are butermilk brined and breaded prior to a trip to the deep-fryer and wrapping them around aged cheddar and sliced bacon.  Loosely wrapped in aluminum foil and drizzled with pure maple syrup, sriracha, plus a bit of garlic and Old Bay infused mayonnaise the sandwich was much like everything else at Joe Beef, brash and unapologetic but at the same time nuanced and subtly sophisticated.\n\nLobster Spaghetti:  The recipe goes a little something like this - A 1.25 lb. lobster, 0.25 lb. house made spaghetti, 2 slices diced bacon, 3 Tbsp Brandy, 0.25 cup peas, 0.25 cup 35% cream, 0.25 cup half-and-half cream, salt, pepper, chopped chives.  The pasta is al dente, the lobster is snappy and sweet, and the sauce is the very definition of decadence - at $49 it is the most expensive item on the menu, but apparently also the most ordered...and for good reason.\n\nPistachio Financier - Maple Ice Cream:  I was told by a friend that while APdC's desserts are 'hit and miss' I should definitely save room for those at Joe Beef. Beginning first with one of the two 'larger' desserts my photos really don't do justice to how big this cake was, but at nearly eight inches in diameter and probably a half inch thick it was great - a thick sponge with great tooth already saturated with butter and almond paste but eager to soak up the creamy maple syrup and ice cream while pistachio granola added more texture.  Always happy to overindulge in desserts this was exactly my 'style' - a standout of the trip.\n\nThe Verdict:  The place is loud, audacious, and cramped while the food is equally brazen and uncompromised but with servers that love their job and chefs who know the basics well enough to nail them yet also  know themselves well enough to take chances there is a whole lot to love about Joe Beef.  While some may say it is derivative of APdC I personally couldn't imaging visiting Montreal again without dining at both because although the cuisine shares some similarity each is an entirely unique experience - Picard's space a self-proclaimed \"bastion of excess\" while McMillan and Morin's restaurant puts less emphasis on the audacity of each dish and more on experiencing their \"Art of Living\" inclusive of food, service, and setting.", "business_id": "tK9gTB4bj4Z-iQ1daqkK7w", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-05", "type": "review"}

About Liberace, it cannot be denied that, beneath the glitz, he was an accomplished pianist; despite his fey demeanor, he inexplicably had women of a certain age swooning at his feet; and his tastes were both extravagant and tacky. Here you'll find eighteen of his thirty-nine pianos (including a rhinestone-covered Baldwin), a Rolls Royce encased in mirror tiles, and a costume gallery featuring his first gold lame jacket, red-white-and-blue hot pants, a pink feathered cape, and a candelabra-shaped ring with platinum candlesticks and diamond flames that puts any contemporay hip hop artist's bling to shame. A Walk of Fame showcases his many awards; a recreation of his Palm Springs bedroom is filled with pieces of rare Moser crystal. There's a cafe serving sandwiches, salads, and specialty coffees, and three days a week the winner of a Liberace sound-alike competition - in piano playing, not vocal inflection - entertains visitors with a musical tribute.

The chicken was well seasoned, flavorful and moist, the mashed potatoes were better than your grandmas and went perfect with the chicken. The veggies were steamed with a delicious seasoning blend and weren't soggy or overlooked at all.\nOh and the French onion soup? It's the best I've ever had. If you've had a bad order of French onion soup, this place will redeem the soup and restore your faith in the tastiness of onions. No joke.\n\nThe service is great, there are plenty of TVs to watch a game, and there is zero obligation whatsoever to socialize.

I went here based on Yelp reviews, which after almost a dozen, averaged 5 stars! But several were from newbies to sushi, so I was skeptical, even with a recent ROTD. Had to try for myself.\n\nYasu's is in the Target/REI mall on the corner of East Cactus and Paradise Valley Parkway West, on the edge of Scottsdale and PV, adjacent the Army Recruiting office! \n\nThe restaurant is immediately recognizable as Japanese owned, by its tasteful and elegant decor in subdued natural tones of wood and stone colors. Clean, modern, with understated class and attention to detail. It isn't large, with only 10 tables inside, 8 4s, a cozy 2 by the sushi bar, and a 6 in front of it, with a small L shaped stool bar next to the sushi bar which only has 2 benches seating 2 each. Outside are 3 more tables in a fenced patio with Tiki lamps aburning. There is a hostess, a Japanese floor manager, several youthful Eurasian servers, and a mostly Latino kitchen staff. Yasu and Takeshi do all the sushi behind the sushi bar, and pace each diner well. \n\nThey specialize in a daily special menu. Samples for a Friday night included:\n- Kampachi (baby yellowtail) $12\n- Kumamoto Oysters (half shel or Sumibi) $10\n- Aji (Spanish Mackerel) or Striped Jack sushi or sashimi ($5.5/$12 and $7.5/$16 respectively)\n- Whole Black Snapper (from the Sumibi Yaki Grill) $20\n- Saikyo Beef Tongue ($8)\n- Grilled Pike ($8.5)\n- Grilled Squid Surume ($13.5)\n- 5 oz Wagyu ($75)\n- Cornflake Shrimp w/Tartar Sauce ($8.5)\n- Karaage Black Snapper ($22)\n- Sake or Miso Steamed Manila Clams ($8.5/$9)\n- Foie Gras w/ Japanese Eggplant $13.5 \nObviously from other reviews, many of these are standard faire daily. \n\nSushi is moderately priced, with basic Nigiri from $4.5 - $5; Exceptions are sweet shrimp ($8), Crab Leg ($6.5) Uni and Mirugai ($7.5). Sashimi are reasonable from $7.5 - $10. Rolls from $4 (Maki type) up to $12 max (hand styled). \n\nI went for a $50 Omakase (I count on you, chef) and Takeshi went to work. \n\n1. Duo Cherrystone Clams on half shell atop its own caligraphy covered ceramic charcoal hotpot, garnished with minced green onions, fresh ginger and a dab of spicy tuna mix, doused with Ponzu sauce, taken to a boil in front of you. OMG! AYKM? ($7.5)\n2. Crystal white Himame (Fluke) fish garnished with minced green onions, morsels of katsuyaboshi (bonita shavings), ponzu, and shaped and decorated to look like a mini sperm whale with eyes and gills ($5.5)\n3. Hard to find Striped Jack (Shimajii) red striped white fish au natural ($7.5)\n4. Saba (Mackerel) served without garnish ($4.5)\n5. Seki-Saba (special mackerel only bought in 2 places in Japan, just arrived today) $6 (smoothest, melt like butter Mackerel you will find!)\n6. Sake (Salmon) Yasu Style: Scored, seared on the Sumibi Yaki Grill for a smokey flavor, sprinked with ponzu sauce (don't dip into shoyu/wasabi!). Best tasting salmon I have had! Soft and flavorful! ($4.5)\n7. 4 inch long narrow hand roll filled with buttery Uni and a hint of spice ($7.5)\n\nTotal with $6 large Asahi Super Dry: $49.\n\nI waited 20 minutes for the sushi bar, and as it happens that I was a single, another single came nearly simultaneously, and we talked, shared sushi, and with Japanese politeness, poured each other's drinks. I shared sushi, and they shared Seared Scallop Carpaccio, which were about 8 small sand dollar sized scallop slices, very tender and white, garnished with minced negi, katsuyoboshi, and ponzu.\n\nI complimented Takeshi (Umai, Oishikatta, Subarashii!) and left him a $20 bill because I was so happy! (I tipped the wait staff, too)\n\nAnything Asian with \"Bistro\" in the name makes me a bit nervous that it is some convaluted Fusion Crap joint trying too hard to be Hip and Chic. Not the case here!\n\nYasu's rivals other sushi-ya in LA, SD, SF, LV and Seattle, and costs less than ones of equal quality and creativity.

To this point unexposed to the restaurant's signature ingredient but soon to be treated to a plethora of pork it was next a small pocket of yolky ravioli that arrived and with flavors harkening breakfast I was again left smiling, a follow-up of terrine-topped choux draped in briny pork fat and reined in by balsamic perhaps the best plate of the night.  Stumbling next with overcooked octopus and guinea fowl that got lost in everything else on the plate it was unsurprisingly with pork that Chef Bonanno righted the ship and although seemingly a bit aggressive given accoutrements of peppers and Calabrian sausage the flavor was actually quite restrained, a light bit of smoke set against creamy potatoes and ample aromatics arriving from the porchetta itself.

Exactly 20 years ago through ownership changes, it was rebranded as Harrah's - becoming the first Las Vegas property as a pseudo flagship of the now former Harrah's Entertainment (Now known as Caesars Entertainment). By \"classic Vegas\" standards, there is no shortage of history at this spot.\n\nEven though the Harrahs / Ceasars lineups and properties have changed often over the years, the same can't really be said for Harrah's Las Vegas. Compared to its more contemporary sister properties, it feels a bit 90s retro here, antiquated to the point where even the resort's amenities feel middle of the road. Call it hard times, but its likely the hotel has seen better days.\n\nLike any good Harrah's property, there are plenty of slots - approximately 1,600 of them in various denominations. Fans of 21 should find plenty of love in the tables, as there are more black jack tables than any other here (Spanish 21 is also available). They could use a few more baccarat tables (only 1?) and craps for the never ending dice fiends. As any one can guess, the casino is fairly pedestrian by mega resort standards but it has most of all the mainstream games. For you players out there, expect decent comps for the dollar and it goes a long way here\n\nDon't expect to be wow'd on the hotel side. Regular rooms of a king or two queen beds aren't going to be all that contemporary and the high end suites are a bit on the limited side, but feature decent amenities for the price. Speaking of prices, they're usually on the lower end for a strip property, but because of the location expect this hotel to be filled quickly.\n\nNightlife? Let's not go there. But if you might crave the firewater, get your drink on at Carnaval (http://www.yelp.com/biz/carnaval-court-bar-and-grill-las-vegas) where its likely to be  Jersey Shore, west coast edition. If you seek something different, try the Piano Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-piano-bar-at-harrahs-las-vegas) where you can see some folks throw down tickling ivory style (a la Jay Chou? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-FdX1D5hVg) while getting your drink on.\n\nHarrah's is more of a family property complete with an arcade for the kids, a wedding chapel for the love birds, a decent swimming pool for the ray catchers and cabana choir, an overpriced healthclub and spa, and convention space for the business folks who wished they were at Caesars Palace instead.\n\nEateries are the worst offenders for me here. Don't get me started on the Flavors Buffet or the embarrassing Toby Keith Restaurant (\"I Love This Bar and Grill\"). Ming's Table (http://www.yelp.com/biz/mings-table-las-vegas) really belongs at Imperial Palace and Winning Streaks Grill is beyond cheesy. I think The Range (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-range-steakhouse-las-vegas) might be the most decent spot to grab a quality meal, but since its a steak house its going to be priciest establishment in the house. Considering everything else Harrah's has to offer, this is definitely not a bad choice during any stay.", "business_id": "65EJzWvIUnE1YwpfW6Jl1Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-11-01", "type": "review"}

The restaurant has a small neighborhood restaurant or cafe feel with hardwood floors and an open (but cozy and not industrial) kitchen.\n\nThe restaurant's decor feels very warm and approachable, but the menu sounds quite ambitious.  Nine On Nine has a tasting menu as well as ingredients you don't often see like squab.\n\nThe bread was standard stuff.  There was a mix of focaccia, country bread and a decent and hearty fruit and nut bread.  The bread was sliced unevenly, but I did like the creamy whipped butter, which was topped with strong salt.\n\nI started with the seared foie gras, which was a small portion.  The foie gras was garnished with spring onion marmalade, brioche, gelatin, and crispy meringue-like pieces.  There were a lot of sweet elements on the plate, but they went well with the foie gras, which had an expected salty flavor.\n\nI thought the onion marmalade was very good--definitely sweet but still with an onion flavor.  I liked the brioche--great outside sear but still soft and moist.  The foie gras was good--buttery, creamy and flavorful.\n\nFor my entree, I went with the squab, which featured both the breast and the legs.  The squab was served with hominy, chorizo, zucchini, arugula, and lemon.  I thought the squab was very good.  The breast was moist, juicy and tender.  It was a little like duck breast but had a bouncier texture.  The legs were crispy and good.\n\nI liked all the sides individually though it was not my favorite combination of flavors.  There was definitely a strong lemon flavor to the dish.\n\nFor dessert, I had the coconut panna cotta, which was garnished with compressed pineapple, kiwi, pink peppercorn brittle, and a kaffir lime sauce.  The panna cotta was good.  It did not have a strong coconut flavor, but I liked the creaminess and lightness of it.\n\nThe fruit was really good.  I liked the brightness, sweetness and tartness that the pineapple and kiwi provided.  The brittle was on the chewy side and did not have that crunch and snap you get with a lot of brittle (but I still liked it).  The brittle had a very strong pink peppercorn flavor.\n\nThe kaffir lime sauce did not add much to the plate.  It did not have a distinct flavor.  It did not have a bad flavor, but I was not a fan of the consistency, which was kind of like snot.\n\nService was good.  My server was pleasant, polite, professional, and knowledgeable about the menu.\n\nPrices were high.  Entrees were in the high $20s and $30s, which made Nine On Nine feel more expensive than Pittsburgh's Salt of the Earth (which seems like a more impressive restaurant).\n\nNine On Nine is a good restaurant.  I thought they did a good job with the foie gras and the squab.  While I was not a huge fan of all of the flavor combinations (especially with the squab), I liked a lot of what was served.  I definitely enjoyed Avenue B more and thought Salt of the Earth felt much more original, but Nine On Nine is still a decent option for an upscale dinner in Pittsburgh.\n\nI am not sure what the parking situation is.

On the outside it looks and might even feel like a place to sit and chat while sipping a cappuccino, but being that it's open 24 hours and just heels away from the noisy casino floor of Paris Las Vegas, it's really just a diner.\n\nEvery casino has a diner and due to the nature of Vegas, they're typically the most popular places to eat at all hours of the day. Le Cafe is somewhere in the middle of the diner spectrum, neither exceptional nor completely downtrodden, offering a typical menu of American food and faux-French food.\n\nSomething I always found decent was their breakfast food. Sausage links, tasty omelettes, and hash browns was a meal they could whip up quickly and rather decently. Some of their sandwiches (namely the French dip) were passable for a solid lunch time option and some of the usual baked pastries that were done daily.\n\nHaving sampled lots of baguette combos, crepes, French onion soup, I just avoid the French items on their menu completely. Most all I've had were mediocre, uninspiring, and overpriced. This is no surprise for any casino cafe / diner establishment, but it's like going to a Japanese place only to find out the burger tastes better than soba / udon / ramen. As a result, some of my colleagues during my time here would commonly refer to this place as, \"Le Crap.\"\n\nBut I am not much of a hater. Paris already is plagued with subpar eateries and most of them are closed before 11pm, which leaves the late night goers few options to enjoy. The key to these types of places is embracing what they do best, which for me was almost always breakfast. Service was for the most part pleasant always and the prices were casino worthy, but thankfully this kind of food is the easiest to comp with player points.", "business_id": "vW4G1hwiW6LkuhAfbeRfqg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-02-27", "type": "review"}

Without a doubt a 'cute' shop with friendly service provided by a young lady named Brenda it was just after 7:00pm when I walked into the small store and with a short line fronted by a woman and her daughter planning a 'Sweet 16' party I spent some time perusing the items and chatting with other customers, seemingly each with a different favorite amongst the store's nearly twenty options.  Featuring plated desserts, custom cakes, jars, cookies, and other take-home treats it was with an eye on variety that I ordered when I approached the front of the line and self-selecting a few favorites along with two selections confirmed by Brenda to be as good as the crowd had suggested I made my way to the door immediately indulging in a buttery cinnamon-laced snickerdoodle with crispy edges and a soft center, the first of a half dozen +1 items tallying $25 after tax and tip.  Showing some restrained and retaining the rest of my purchase for the twenty-seven minute drive home it was with coffee in hand that I continued my tasting first with a bananas-foster-esque cupcake that was plenty moist but somewhat marred by overly sweet frosting but moving on to the dense peanut butter blondie things improved substantially, the dense square loaded with rich chocolate tones and roasted organic peanut butter, a classic combo only improved after a minute on a warm skillet.  Moving finally to what has seemingly become LoVullo's 'signature' item, it was with a quartet of macarons that I rounded out my evening and with each palm-sized cookie featuring a characteristic crackle over rich flavors, the texture of the crmb was actually far more dense than the Parisian classic - a moist cake-like consistency akin to the American whoopie pie and although perhaps not 'traditional,' entirely delicious - both the dense chocolate dipped Snickers and rich, savory Fig and Goat Cheese \"Whooparons\" undoubtedly justifying the nearly hour-long round trip...though if they ever decide to expand I definitely see a market for a second shop in ever trendy Summerlin.", "business_id": "SAU9NDWNuR0Jvgx38T8wsA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-02-25", "type": "review"}

Owned and operated by Martin Picard Au Pied de Cochon had been on my food bucket list for almost as long as a trip to see Les Habitants for obvious reasons...I just hoped my mother and picky aunt could find something on the menu they'd like.\n \nThe Reservation:  Having made mention of this above I'll admit the plan was a little convoluted, but it worked out perfectly - one reservation at 5:00pm for appetizers and entrees, a second reservation at 10:30pm for dessert, coffee, and maybe more.  I knew we'd overeat.  I was okay with this.\n\nThe Space:  Located on what is essentially a side street amongst other stores and eateries the wooded exterior of APdC is quite unassuming and arriving early parking was a cinch.  With doors unlocked we were the first to arrive and given our choice of seats we opted for a spot up front near the window of the long and narrow space.  Wooden and rustic with an open kitchen spanning nearly the entirety of the space up to a long bar in back the only thing \"formal\" about the space is the linen napkins and stemware - the rest feels like a cozy cabin and a tribute to many things Canadian.  \n\nThe Service:  Superlative.  From watching Chef Picard himself haul in a large case of Foie Gras and innumerable loaves of bread before stopping by to say hello to our primary server, a young blonde woman, everyone just seemed happy to be at Au Pied de Cochon - an atmosphere that was entirely in harmony with the food and extended from front of the house to the back both at 5:00pm and again at 10:30.  With both the standard menu and a list of eight specials described at length and our time constraints noted with regard to preparation and presentation  it would be hard to ask for better service than what we received at APdC - it was Michelin Star quality.\n\nThe Food:  Complimentary Bread and Butter, House Muddled Strawberry Lemonade, Six Appetizers, Two Entrees, Three Desserts, and Coffee.\n\nFresh Bread with House butter:  I have no idea where Picard gets his bread but they bring it in by the bushel and served up warm with unsalted butter the only challenge was not to eat too much.  A crusty French baguette with good crunch and better chew plus a bit of salinity juxtaposing yeasty notes this was as good as much of the bread service in Paris.\n\nFoie gras cromesquis:  Think of these as liquid foie gras nuggets.  Order them.  Eat them.  Bask in the gluttony.\n\nTomato Tart:  Knowing my aunt would struggle with the meat-centric menu I also knew this would be right up her ally and as much as it may seem odd to order such a thing at Au Pied de Cochon I would strongly recommend it.  Essentially nothing more than a buttery puff pastry topped with herbs, olive oil, a bit of gruyere, and incredibly fresh tomatoes the tart was acidic and bright yet creamy and balanced plus big enough to share and probably enough to serve as a meal for some.\n\nFrench Onion Soup:  Another order fitting my aunt's palate, though certainly not traditional, was this pork and lard based French Onion soup. Generally not a fan of the classic form of this dish I think I actually enjoyed this dish the most of anyone at the table as the swine based broth was thick and full - almost like that of ramen - with plenty of fatty pork and root vegetables beneath the bubbling dome of cheese.  Great on its own and more-so when used for dipping bread this is another great choice for those not wanting one of the more substantial plates on Picard's menu. \n\n\"The Monte Cristo:\" One of the daily specials I somehow talked my mother into ordering this and although she was hesitant it ended up being a hit with everyone at the table.  Limited to only \"about a dozen\" sandwiches that evening and featuring thick maple-custard dredged brioche French toast topped with imported jambon, local turkey, and a blend of Gruyere and Comte plus spreads of guinea hen liver mousse, maple butter, apple jelly, and caramelized onions there was really no part of the palate that this enormous \"appetizer\" did not touch on and with a drizzle of maple syrup to finish the plate the biggest shock was that every flavor came through with aplomb.  Certainly gluttonous but entirely delicious this and what followed certainly displayed Picard's propensity for 'shock n' awe' cuisine but honestly, it works.\n\n...to be continued.", "business_id": "KKucN3P6aH84MCfPr56a8g", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-10", "type": "review"}

My glass was never empty- he took the time to make us feel so welcome and he was quick with a quip (which I love!)

But who cares?:  He really took our night from just another night out to a great night out and for that he deserves a shout out!\n\nWe started with some chacuterie and bread along with some type of stacked sandwiches.  For our entrees we had a couple of their thin crust pizzas as well as two of their signature pasta dishes.  All were quite good.  And for dessert? Tiramasu which almost had us licking the jar it came in.\n\nBar North is located in the Kierland Commons mall so parking is plentiful.  I also liked that it opens onto to a common patio which would be great for people watching on a warmer day (it was cold when we were there).  And the decor is contemporary and understated with candles twinkling in the windows only to be matched by the crystals dangling from the exposed bulbs in the center of the room.\n\nAll in all a really great choice for a fun dinner out!", "business_id": "N80E9zoWEpHhi4kH2eKAsw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-01-15", "type": "review"}

This event in particular was a great fit for Yelp: participants got to try out a new business and provide them with feedback and unofficial publicity, while trying an unusual workout that we otherwise might not have gotten the chance to experience.\nI don't know about most people, but I don't like being the only one to try new things- especially when there are witnesses and a learning curve.\n\nSurfSet wasn't too hard to find once we had the address- signed in and filled out a waiver, then took off our socks and shoes and headed for the boards. The main room had perhaps 20 boards balanced on balls, facing a single board for an instructor to demo on, and mirrors on the side walls. The best part was the projected film of people surfing waves above the studio, it really added to the beachy feel. The music also was very well-selected, lots of lighthearted island covers of alt hits.  \n\nThe workout itself sounds tough, but it's even tougher to actually do. I consider myself fairly active and I like to think I'm fairly good with my balance. In this class, I was the least coordinated one who fell off my board the most often. Ours was a \"blend\" class, combining elements of core work, strength training, and cardio all in one in alternating sets. I liked the format of the class and am strongly considering scooping up their featured Groupon for 8 classes- I figure by then perhaps I will have redeemed myself.\n\nI'm actually looking forward to feeling sore tomorrow, because I left feeling frustrated with myself for not trying harder, which is also part of what is driving me to go again and try to kick this stupid board's butt.\n\nOur instructor was a great guy who took the time to go around the room and help us fix our form when necessary- especially for my lunges, which I struggle with already even on flat, stable land.

Playing on instincts and personal tastes but more than happy to allow the clerk to guide my hand it was with a few \"standards\" that I began and with the cupcake moist and dense beneath light buttercream while the baklava arrived crisp and intensely sweet the 'familiar' products would only get better from there, the macarons my pick for most Parisian-authentic in the city as a crisp bite gave way to a light crumb and filling that was ever slightly too thick, but nicely flavored and richly textured like that of Laduree at nearly half the price.  Moving on to more novel options, it was with personal interest and love for mille feuille that I ordered Manan's \"crispy version\" and with crisp layers divided by light cream before being rolled in fluffy icing and crunchy coconut-tinged flakes the Napoleon was not a bit soggy, just light, lovely, and perhaps the best non-traditional version I've experienced to date; an impetus for a later return to check out the 'standard' version which I'd venture to be equally delicious, particularly with seasonal fruits incorporated in the cream.  Focusing last on the two \"must try\" items suggested by my server, it was with the bird milk roll that I began and although good I personally found the cake to be a bit dry, my tastes instead trending toward the appropriately named \"dream cake\" whose Napoleon like crunchy layers of graham were divided by a lacquer of thick, nutty milk-jam while buttery crumble and light pastry cream added just enough levity to reign in the intense sweetness - a perfect complement to a good cup of coffee later that evening and something I'll absolutely return for soon, along with the Gata, Yojik, Manan Cake, Kartoshka, and Mikado...maybe the Smiling Cake, Nutella Napoleon, and Fruit Cookies as well.", "business_id": "iwFGxwkDJQhPSI1Cj24QYQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-02-24", "type": "review"}

Knowing this place would blow him away, I saved it for precisely the right moment.\n\nWe went in and immediately fell in love with the interior d\u00e9cor and atmosphere- there was a musician in the corner singing covers of easy-listening hits, small mismatched tables and chairs arranged in cozy groups, and little trinkets sprinkled everywhere.

Dumplings were great (though few, the order comes with 4 so it's shareable but only barely), loved that they weren't overcooked as they have been elsewhere we've ordered them.

They're fried beef dumplings, similar in size and shape to a large potsticker, topped with green onion and dill. The dill especially really complements the filling, you'll want to pinch up extra from around the plate. \nTHRACIAN CLAY POT: a small-looking portion served in the clay pot it's made in, the dish is composed of tomato, egg, sausage, peppers, feta, and onion. Reminiscent of shakshuka, and best eaten with some of the homemade bread.\nBISCUIT CAKE: a take on tiramisu, super moist and flavorful with just the right amount of chocolate to make it sweet but not overwhelmingly so.

My friend was hosting the Tweetup and I love Pizza, so why not?  I'm glad I made it!\n\nThere was a special buffet of food setup just for the event.  Salad, Chicken Wings, Baked Ziti, and of course Pizza!  The Pizzas that were available were Pepperoni, Meat Lovers, Chicken & Artichoke, and Cheese.  I ate a slice of every Pizza, a little Salad, about a dozen Wings, and a small portion of Baked Ziti.  I wasn't planning on eating that much...I swear....but the food was sooo good and the owner, Biaggio, came out and insisted that we try everything!  How could I say no?\n\nThe Pizza is NY style thin crust.....and damn it's awesome.  It folds just right and the proportion of Cheese and Sauce is perfect.  The Meat on the Meat Lover's Pizza is something else too....I don't know if I could ever be a Vegetarian.  I suggest eating the Pizza fresh as the slices can get greasy fast...especially with the Meat Lovers.\n\nThe Wings were served plain with the Hot Sauce and Dipping Sauces on the side.  Biaggio told us that the Salad Dressing/Dipping Sauces are all made from scratch in the kitchen.  The Bleu Cheese dressing was awesome....didn't have any of the others.  The Wings are battered and were cooked just right....not too greasy, which is how I like them.\n\nThe Salad was ok....I didn't have much of it though because I ate so much of everything else.  The Baked Ziti was great too.....the Cheese was gooey and full of flavor.\n\nAfter I was done eating, Biaggo brought out Fried Dough sprinkled with Sugar & Chocolate....I had to have a bite....yum!  Then he brought out a cake for his Son's Birthday....what, more food?!  I took a couple of slices home....I couldn't eat any more.\n\nOverall, the event was fun and the food was plentiful and awesome.\n\nI spied the menu and saw that they serve Breakfast too.....I don't know how I'm going to lose any weight with this place in existence!\n\nWill I return?  Are you kidding me?!  I want to try Breakfast and their Subs, and a bunch of other things on their menu....of course I'll be back!", "business_id": "fSs0EdKmLJ7VULejtsi9CQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-10-20", "type": "review"}

A truly beautiful restaurant, tucked away from the Casino in in typical Mina fashion (Michael Mina Bellagio, Stripsteak, Pub 1842, etc,) I was seated in a corner booth and greeted quickly with a glass of champagne and electing for a cocktail to go with dinner my meal began promptly with Chef Mina's classic corn bread in a muffin form and doing my best to temper eating these by the dozen I still managed to order a second basket as I progressed through six savory courses and two rounds of dessert inclusive of amuses and palate cleansers, plus sides paired with my final savory.  Focused squarely on the sea with fish generally out of the waters no more than 24 hours each and every plate that arrived was prepared to a lightly cooked exterior and delicate rare internal temperature, the tender scallop balancing a creamy piece of foie gras and the shrimp and grits particularly impressive while the lion fish was flaky and light, beautifully complimented by the brine of the mussel chowder and smoky pork.  Always happy to overindulge on dessert, even though the hush puppies were like sweet and savory crawdad doughnuts, the team at American Fish continued the trend of very impressive sweets that I've seen from Baltimore to Detroit to Vegas and San Jose with a quartet of options where doughnuts and bread pudding both shined and cheesecake wowed; the lightness of the mascarpone something I generally don't anticipate in the dish but truly impressive in the setting of light vanilla cream and reduced berries.", "business_id": "_5k83wy9_5NpErw7Ecgt3g", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-11-17", "type": "review"}

At $2.25 for a cup that is literally bottomless I could see this being dangerous if I went on a day when I was with my books to read.\n\nBlueberry Cornmeal Hotcakes:  At $10.95 this is the menu item I would have ordered during my visit to the original had the Chocolate Chip Pumpkin French toast not been a chalkboard special and true to the rumors the hotcakes did not disappoint.  Golden and crisp on the exterior with a slight bit of grit to the interior crumb each of the three cakes was packed with bursting blueberries and slightly buttery even without the addition of extra.  Served with a side of pure maple syrup (the sort they charge you extra for at Matt's) if there is a better pancake in the Valley I'd be surprised.\n\nCinnamon Roll French Toast with a side of Grilled Ham:  A $12.95 chalkboard special requested without the cream cheese icing my dining buddy this lovely dish featured a house made cinnamon roll cut lengthwise, then sliced vertically, and finally dredged in rich vanilla batter before a trip to the skillet.  Golden on the outside, cinnamon sugar caramelized within, and served with a bowl of fresh fruit plus natural maple syrup and grilled Niman Ranch ham I'm pretty sure it would have been better with icing, but it was pretty darn good without while the ham was rich, moist, and suitably smoky without being too saline.\n\nSouthwest Biscuits and Gravy:  A gift from the kitchen described jokingly by the owner as \"something you won't find in San Francisco\" this small sample of one of the chalkboard specials featured a rich and flaky biscuit topped with smooth gravy rife with jalapenos and red peppers plus chorizo.  Clearly not a dish terribly concerned with being subtle I really enjoyed the texture of the biscuit and although my modest Midwestern tongue needed copious water to quell the heat I actually enjoyed how the bright acidity of the peppers helped to keep the gravy from being too thick and heavy.\n\nCinnamon Roll:  At $3.50 this cinnamon roll would prove to be good, but when compared to the rest of the meal really nothing special.  Served warm with the frosting slowly cascading down the sides of the buttery bun it is not that there was anything 'wrong' with this dish - it just was not nearly as good as the French toast interpretation even though it was equally amply endowed with butter and cinnamon.\n\nBlueberry White Chocolate Streusel Muffin:  One of two daily muffins and perhaps the steal of the morning at $2.50 this dense muffin was not only large in size but huge on flavor.  Served halved and warmed with a bit of cornmeal interspersed in the otherwise rich and buttery batter the highlight of this muffin was the smoothness of the white chocolate and how it melded with the rich streusel topping to form an ample foil to the sweet and tender berries.  One of the better blueberry muffins I've had in recent memory it took restraint to not order the chocolate chip coconut variation on the muffin as well.\n\nPeach Cobbler Crumble Cake with Whipped Cream:  While I guess I could fault the service here in that they originally forgot the whipped cream I cannot and will not do so because in all reality the addition of house made whipped cream to this $5.50 slab of cake was the very definition of gilding the proverbial lily.  Beginning with a batter as light as angel food yet unmistakably imbued with plenty of butter and sweetened local peaches what truly made this cake stand out was a tan ripple I can best describe as cinnamon butter cake running from edge to edge and a lightly toasted topping equally rife with the aromatic spice and just enough sugar to caramelize.  Bite for bite this was probably my favorite dish of the morning, but showing a bit of restraint given the day of eating yet to come I was glad to let some of it go home with my friend - to call the portion 'generous' would be an understatement to say the least.\n\nThe Verdict:  Bearing in mind my obvious predilection to breakfast sweets over breakfast savories and the fact that I'd been told all the Bay Area's recipes had been ported over faithfully I had no doubts that walking into Dottie's Scottsdale that I would like the food; what surprised me most was how much I enjoyed the scene and the service - both equally well carried over from San Francisco.  Having said before that Dottie's is one of the very few breakfasts I'd actually wait an hour in line for and living in a city where it seems everyone is willing to wait hours in line for Matt's Big Breakfast I personally see Dottie's True Blue Caf\u00e9 as a sort of breakfast ideal - food good enough to wait in line for, but without the line.  I'll definitely be back - and likely at the exclusion of wasting a moment of a Bay Area vacation time or waiting in line at Matt's ever again.", "business_id": "qKBdXH1kZNU-c9BHQaTUag", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-28", "type": "review"}

Moving from cupcake to the only item that would prove the least bit dull, suffice it to say that monkey bread is found better elsewhere, but moving on to arching layers not the least bit burdened by frangipane beneath a shattering shell I'd be really surprised if a better almond croissant can be found in town.

With that said, I've now been to La Grande Orange Grocery and Pizzeria four times in four months and if you count Chelsea's kitchen as part of the LGO empire that number becomes five - the most times I've been to any single space except perhaps the quick casual and fast food restaurants I frequented during my childhood and early years of college.\n\nDescribed simply as \"an organic coffee and breakfast bar, caf\u00e9, pizzeria, and funky retail grocery\" La Grande Orange was one of the first places I visited on my seminal trip to Phoenix and the place I first suggested to my mother after driving cross country to pick up gifts for my sister and aunt back home. Sort of like The Cracker Barrel (for mainstream reference - I apologize to those I may have offended) or Southport Grocery and Caf\u00e9 (more appropriately) in scope with a small store and bakery up front and a full-fledged kitchen/restaurant in back I'd originally planned to write my standard review of LGO and all of the things I've purchased, eaten, and loved but eventually decided that such a mission would be shortsighted and considering the fact that I now own a home in Phoenix also rather futile - unless they close/burn down or I move/die this list will simply grown and grow.  Instead what I will do from here on out is seasonal updates with salient notes and pictures; from the black and white garden gnome salt&pepper shakers, toad banks and elk-horn knives to the baked goods, pancakes, and pizzas I love this place.\n\nEthiopian Reserve Coffee/Decaf/Black and Tan from ROC2:  I'd be lying if I didn't admit that at least half the reason I spend so much time at LGO is related to the free Wi-Fi and copious refills of coffee from The Roastery of Cave Creek.  Owned and operated by Dave Anderson and Michael Smith with operations not far from my home I've been lucky enough to enjoy some of their single origins from Central America, but for a blend the two offered up at LGO are both excellent with brighter citrus notes accenting the Ethiopian and lower cocoa and earthen notes in the Black and Tan.  Beats wildflower or paradise any day of the week in the battle for best freely refillable coffee.\n\nCroque Madame with Whole Wheat, Tomato, Egg, Ham, Gruyere:  I don't like Dijon and as such I requested the Croque without and what I received was superlative as the savory ham and aged gruyere were briny and bold yet tamed admirably by the crusty bread and sweet, bright tomatoes.  Topped off with a runny egg, sea salt, and just a touch of cracked pepper this wasn't quite a traditional croque but it was delicious...though the accoutrements of sour pickles and sweet melon didn't really 'fit.'\n\nFamous French Pancakes with honey, strawberries, and cr\u00e8me fraiche:  My grandmother was Hungarian and as I remember it she was also a very good cook, a talent my mother unfortunately did not inherit save for a couple of dishes; one of these dishes was Hungarian palacsinta or sweet pancakes.  Sort of like a French crepe but with a bit more tooth LGO's \"French Pancakes\" reminded me much more of palacsinta than crepe and while others may think this a bad thing I thought it was sublime.  When mom comes back to visit this is on the short list of 'must tries.'\n\nBlueberry Muffin with Whole Wheat Streusel:  Admitting my sweet tooth and wearing it on my sleeve, the first of many pastries sampled at LGO (aside from the Red Velvet Cupcake during my recruitment trip) was this, a killer whole wheat muffin topped with buttery cinnamon streusel and literally bursting with fresh blueberries.  Clearly seasonal with their focus on using fresh, never frozen ingredients I was stunned by the quality of the berries as summer had recently come to a close but hefty in butter and berries while light and fluffy on the bite this was a great muffin.\n\nPumpkin Spice Muffin:  A second muffin, this one just before Halloween, was even better than the first in terms of composition - and with a surprise burst of tangy cream cheese filling on the inside a contender for best pumpkin novelty I've had in recent memory.  Big and bold with the flavors of pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg all perfuming the palate and moist like pumpkin pie without being wet I particularly loved the salty toasted pumpkin seeds topping off the muffin - a savory touch that worked nicely with the sweet filling.\n\n...more to come", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-26", "type": "review"}

I didn't think so. You're probably like me and Jamie. You're probably staying at the Paris Las Vegas on a weekend discount package.

It's fairly quiet at this hour with the faux-Paris hallway with only a smattering of drunken tourists. The main dining room is closed, so you just walk up to the kiosk and order. Jamie and I split a $8.99 \"Favorite\" which was all sort of berries hidden under a large folded crepe. Lot of whipped cream, powdered sugar and berry puree oozing all over it (see my photo).

WTF??? So, we decided to come back on Christmas Day as soon as it opens and get in.\n\nChristmas morning, we arrived in line for the buffet at 11:07am (7 minutes after it opened) and there was a long line already. So what do we do? We get in line. I hate buffets. I hate waiting in line even more. However, it WAS Christmas and I did agree to hubby's request of wanting to eat here. He's been wanting to eat at the Wynn buffet the last few times we visited but I said no.\n\nSo there we were standing in line. Mind you, this isn't even the the line leading into the buffet. This was the line against the wall on the opposite side of the buffet. This is where you get a full view of all the people eating INSIDE in the dining room and all you can do is wait.\n\nThe line moves slowly. Luckily a friend was with us and so we were chatting. When the Wynn girls walked around passing out complimentary bottled water I was highly impressed and decided that the hotel was superb in customer service but still, the damn buffet better be mindblowingly good (yeah Frank K -- his suggestion for the Wynn buffet) to compensate for this waiting.\n\nBelieve it or not, but exactly 2 hours later we were at the front of the line, but not before forking over 50 bucks per person (lil guy was half price) tax included to go in for the \"Christmas Feast\".\n\nAfter we were seated, we made our way to the buffet. I was impressed by the lack of pushing and shoving along the buffet line. In fact, there just seemed to be very few people in the dining area. It then dawned on me that they make you wait because they didn't want their dining area to look and feel like a cafeteria which is essentially what a buffet is all about. This way, it still feels extremely civilized even though you're going through the lines like you do at a cafeteria and helping yourself to food.\n\nPROS: Peel and eat shrimps were already peeled and were large instead of the regular miniature sized ones you get at other buffets. The Alaskan King crab legs were fresh and not frozen. There was also smoked salmon, white anchovies, smoked trout and other smoked fish. Lobster/shrimp bisque was excellent.\n\nCONS: Although there was an abundance of meat such as lamb chops, the chops were overcooked and really dry. I was so disappointed that they ruined the lamb chops. The prime rib was rather good but again, I only like the end piece and it was really dry like jerky. The lamb shank was again over cooked.\n\nThere was also Chinese food including a few items of dim sum and roasted duck, Italian selections (which included thin crust pizza -- lackluster), a fish station with things such as halibut wrapped in bacon and a soup station. Like I said the bisque was fabulous but the french onion was way too salty. \n\nI think the Wynn uses really great ingredients to put their buffet together, but the execution of it was poor. They ruined great cuts of meat by overcooking and ruined the ceviches by bad marinades. For 50 bucks I had expected a lot more. The variety was very minimal as well for the 50 dollar price tag. I had expected a lot more variety especially since it was called a \"Christmas Feast\".  The regular dinner buffet is usually 10 dollar less but even so, if this was all they served I would say at 40 bucks a pop it was overpriced as well.\n\nThe desserts were hit and miss. The creme brulees were torched on site before placing on the shelves, but the creme itself was watery. The sorbet and gelato were also hit and miss in flavor depending on which one you got. I did enjoy the cheesecake and the sago (tapioca) pudding.\n\nTo have waited 2 hours for this meal garners it a mediocre rating at best. Not worth a 2 hour wait and definitely not worth its 50 dollar price tag.", "business_id": "YNQgak-ZLtYJQxlDwN-qIg", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-12-28", "type": "review"}

I have probably had much better ice cream desserts since then; it did not really stand up as well today.

The ice cream was a kind of light and whipped ice cream (kind of like Thrifty ice cream), which is not my favorite style of ice cream.\n\nThe sundae also had the problem of melting too quickly.

Known by the term 'Riserva' and nowhere present on the restaurant menu our eight-top's 240+ day dry-aged steak experience actually began years prior with selective sourcing, breeding, feeding, butchery, as well as storage - an aged bacteria direct from Italy driving the latter - and with each stage described at length throughout the course of a 3.5 hour meal that entailed no less than twenty other outstanding plates plus far too many drinks it can only be said that nothing could have prepared us for the meal's apex, four different steaks plus a chop offering an education in things few will ever have the opportunity to taste.  Having already visited Carnevino twice, with wowed results each time, it seems almost a crime to gloss over items like a textbook bellini thick with white peach or tartare so tender it simply dissolved on the tongue but with all apologies to tender pastas including the famous beef cheek ravioli as well as the \"super chicken\" egg raviolo suffice it to say that only a single side of mushrooms was less than exemplary...but not a one of them could match the meats, the younger steaks and chop easily on par with those from last year while the Riserva was almost unimaginably tender with a flavor profile that ranged from walnuts to stilton to truffles as a buttery basenote lingered in each bite.   Undoubtedly a big budget event in a space not unaccustomed to such things it was finally with a table of desserts followed by a small plate of cookies that the evening would end and visited by head chef Nicole Brisson before our departure each of us said our thanks - an invite to tour the aging facility something I look forward to doing soon and a return visit already in the planning stages for when my friends are next in town.\n\nConsidered by some, including myself, to be the best steakhouse in the country even before this meal suffice it to say that Carnevino upped the stakes (and steaks) for all future meals here in Las Vegas - the private room, the exquisite services, the specially requested soundtrack of Pearl Jam's Ten played throughout the restaurant, more than a handful of 'gifts' joining each course, and especially the Riserva all making a special meal truly world class.", "business_id": "3MmHmJXr8Ltk_Z5EGE4KUw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-21", "type": "review"}

It is from a celebrity chef (Hubert Keller), but it is a relatively inexpensive restaurant (at least compared to the many expensive celebrity chef backed fine dining restaurants on The Strip).  It also primarily features two items--burgers and milkshakes--that are very popular.  Finally, Hubert Keller was on Top Chef Masters and showcased this restaurant as well as his burger skills so many might be intrigued with this one if they saw that season of Top Chef Masters on the Food Network.\n\nThis Burger Bar (there is also one located in the Macy's in San Francisco) is housed in Mandalay Place--a mini-mall within Mandalay Bay that features a few retail and dining options.  It is a fairly small place and the menu showcases a build-your-own-burger concept where you pick your burger protein--several types of beef, lamb, buffalo, turkey, and veggie as well as chicken breast and salmon.  You then choose your desired bun as well as all kinds of toppings including raw vegetables, grilled vegetables, many types of cheese (standard stuff like American and cheddar but also brie and smoked Gouda), several sauces, additional proteins like bacon and prosciutto, and finally a few premium ingredients like seared foie gras and black truffle.  You can also order one of their signature chef's burger creations so you do not have to make any choices.\n\nIn addition to their burgers, Burger Bar also serves all kinds of fried food from French fries and onion rings to zucchini fries and mozzarella sticks.  Chicken wings and a few salads are available too.\n\nI went the build-your-own-burger route and opted for their Prime ground beef and added bacon, smoked Gouda and spinach on a potato bun.  The burger was okay.  I thought the burger at the newer Gordon Ramsay BurGR was much better--the beef was much juicier there and it featured both a higher quality bun as well as higher quality toppings.  The burger at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar was okay, but only the really thick and meaty (crispy but also chewy) bacon stood out.  The bun felt very plain for a gourmet burger spot.\n\nI also opted for one of their milkshakes.  They have all kinds of milkshakes from build-your-own-milkshakes with many toppings to signature creations.  I tried their caramel latte, which featured coffee ice cream, caramel syrup, graham crackers, and butterscotch morsels.  It was a great mix of caramel and coffee and the milkshake had a great thick and creamy consistency (very addictive and hard to put down).\n\nService was good--pleasant and quick.\n\nPrices are reasonable for a notable Las Vegas restaurant.  Burger Bar's prices are higher than similar gourmet burger restaurants in other big cities like Los Angeles, but that is to be expected given that Burger Bar is on The Strip.  Burger Bar does offer a decent meal that comes at a much lower price than the many celebrity chef backed (and very pricey) fine dining restaurants on The Strip.\n\nI remember liking Burger Bar more on my first trip.  It is not too surprising that the quality has dropped since then; the quality standards at many Vegas restaurants seem to slip if it has been around for a long time.  Hubert Keller's Burger Bar is still a decent spot, but Gordon Ramsay BurGR at Planet Hollywood is a much better option for an gourmet burger on The Strip.\n\nBurger Bar is located in Mandalay Place, which is attached to Mandalay Bay.  Like other major casinos and hotels on The Strip, Mandalay Bay offers both complimentary self and valet parking.", "business_id": "xyTJYlbE_MLouK6rCou6zg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-05", "type": "review"}

Admittedly intrigued by the sandwiches but preferring to focus on pastry it was with mild disappointment that Illy was the only brew offered as I find their over-roasted beans poorly suited for much but with this small quibble aside the glut soon to arrive would by-and-large impress, the simple  croissant on par with those of Paris as shattering layers gave way to echoing caverns of butter while four items laced with high quality chocolate each proved superlative - the crispy rimmed cookie near-molten at its core and the torte rich in taste but ethereal in texture.  Not quite as impressive or diverse as Bonjour Bakery, La Belle Terre, or Thomas Keller's Bouchon but featuring a combination of great pastry and lovely service that sets it apart Baguette Caf\u00e9 is every bit the local gem that many have claimed and although hours and coffee will prevent frequent visits I've no doubt I'll find my way back eventually if not for a full meal at least for thing; an almond financier beyond my superlatives warrants any presumed hassles of location or time, even rush-hour on the 215.", "business_id": "OHsuvX4rmhnPvvRBb-QK7A", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-05-02", "type": "review"}

I preferred the bowl, which was layered with quinoa (brown rice was another menu option), veggies, and shrimp, with a lemon sauce and mint. Initial impression was that the dish was very watery, but it had good flavor to it.  the lemon flavor and the mint/basil in the bottom of the dish worked well together. Flavor was light and borderline bland- saw many guys around the dining room dousing their food in hot sauce, seems to be an issue for many dishes.\nThe salad was okay: considering the word \"beet\" was used in the name, i expected a slightly more plentiful portion of it. Salad also consisted of apple and walnut,  we added on steak for an extra $4 charge. Steak itself was dry and overcooked, portion wasn't worth $4. Salad also came with an interesting herbal dressing, but there was very little of it, rendering this salad fairly dry, which is why it wasn't as liked as the bowl above.\n\nPricing overall was relatively fair, $10 per dish including our add-ons, but the salad was disappointing.

However, I'm basing it on the entire experience and here's how it went.\n\nWe arrived well after the 3pm check in time. My friend had requested an upgrade for me but the gal who checked me in didn't mention it at all, nor did she say 'sorry we can't offer it to you' or anything to that effect. Just no mention. She did however mention the fact that it was our 10 yr anniversary and said she was giving us a bottle of complimentary champagne. Oh well, better than nothing right?\n\nSo we go up to the room and guess what? Housekeeping was IN the room cleaning up. I was super pissed now. I was exhausted and really just wanted to relax, but instead, I went back downstairs and had the gal give me another room. \n\nOK, so back up again and I called my friend who requested an upgrade for us and he informed me that he had arranged for the upgrade to a suite and for me to call back down to the front desk. So I called and found out that the suites only had one bed and we needed two, so we decided to just decline the offer and stay where we were.\n\nAbout an hour in the room, we get a call from the front desk asking us if we were going to upgrade. Hubby was like \"WTF? Don't they communicate amongst each other?\". We had to tell them NO. Believe it or not, after a few more hours, some housekeeping manager comes to our room, knocks and then opens our door. When she saw us inside she was taken aback and then asked us \"you're leaving tonight right?\" I was like \"NO, we JUST checked in today\".\n\nSo I was really annoyed with this whole check-in process and even more so by the fact that they were all clueless. We did eventually get our complimentary champagne, but we weren't in the room and it was left outside when we returned later that night. Wasn't anything special -- something we'd never heard of .... we never drank it, brought it home still unopen.\n\nNow to the room itself. I liked the large plasma tv in the room which accommodated our Wii. There is a mount for your iPod which is nice if you brought your's along. Bathrooms were much smaller than other hotels, but it was alright.... I don't spend a lot of time in there so it doesn't really matter to me. The beds were very comfortable and they had the nice quilt blankets which I like. I hate those polyester blankets with a passion and I don't stay in hotels which have those if I can help it.\n\nThere is a mini bar in the room but don't touch it at all costs. The gal told me at check in that it's weight sensored and if you touch it you'll be charged. Hubby looked at the menu -- $4 for a can of diet coke, $71 for the Hennessey and mind you, it's the little teenie bottle -- SHUDDUP! RIGHT?\n\nThe hotel itself shows its age. The young man said it felt \"Hawaiian-ish\" in the lobby which I guess is true. The casino was really boring. I spent 2 nights in there on the slots but since this is an older hotel, the casino itself isn't very big so everything is jam packed into this small space. I got bored pretty quickly, and even though I spent  2 nights there, it was only for a few hours\n\nOn our last night I called down to see if they could offer us an extra night at the same rate. The woman who picked up the phone was very curt and sounded impatient. She said \"this is our rate\" and that's that. I thought it was interesting how at a time like this, when occupancy rate is down and the entire economy of the country is in such shambles, that they'd rather have an empty room than fill it, and also, the display of such bad customer service is laughable.\n\nThe only thing I liked about this hotel was the room, but then hubby thought it was smaller than the other hotels we've stayed at on the strip but gives off the illusion that it was larger due to furniture placement.

BF and I are on a health food kick but still like dining out- the reviews here made me order the Ahi Tuna Tacos and the Mediterranean chicken wrap, add chicken. We split the orders, along with a side of Brussels sprouts, and were both full and happy, for just under $30. Not bad!\n\nFirst impression is that this place is small but organized, and has a light and natural decor scheme. I like the grass theme that managed to be everywhere from the walls to the window stickers and the menu. The TV-screen menu with images of each dish was a nice touch.\n\nI'm not usually an ahi tuna taco fan, but when you see so many reviews in a row raving about them, you try them. And, here at Daily Kitchen, I think I found a new favorite dining-out dish! The three tacos are a hefty portion and the tacos themselves are super tasty, with a spicy sauce that sneaks up on you, a light and crunchy slaw for texture and extra veggies, and a good amount of fresh ahi. I think I could eat these three times a week and not get bored. I may even try to test that theory- they're that good. Pricing is okay- for $13, I had expected a side.\n\nThe Mediterranean wrap on lavash with chicken is gigantic. I didn't finish my half and took it home for later. The lavash wrap is light, and the wrap is packed with tons of grilled chicken ($3 add on cost, great serving size), creamy hummus, and veggies. I only found one kalamata olive in my half, which is a good thing because their flavor is so strong that it totally overpowers the bite that it's in.  Serving size was very good on this, and the brussels sprout side was also a giant and delicious portion- I'm not sure what was on them, if they were just cooked in olive oil or if there was liquid crack in the saute, but they were phenomenal. Way better value than a generic side of sweet potato fries- though to be fair, I haven't tried them here.\n\nMark this down as a new favorite place for us!

If you don't know where it is, you will easily pass by it a couple of times, even with a GPS in your car. \n\nIf you are planning to meet someone here, give yourself extra time, unless you're a regular.", "business_id": "5JttbbCsaLK_OmJt30CEaw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-10", "type": "review"}

Essentially a double shot glass served on a stone the Foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam was lovely.  Best eaten with a spoon the liver itself was surprisingly mild and melded perfectly (as expected) with the sweet port.  Topped with a foam lending salinity and levity I found this to be a restrained opening flavor that not only paired well with the champagne, but also gave a glimpse of what was to come.\n\nLE FOIE GRAS en duo m\u00eal\u00e9 de pomme ratte comme un carpaccio aux copeaux de truffe blanche, the dish was described as a carpaccio of foie gras and new potatoes topped with black and white truffle shavings.  A large portion of foie gras and potatoes I'll note that the truffles, though present, played a less prominent role than I'd have hoped.  With chipped parmesan and thin blades of greens and daikon also intertwined in the dish each bite was a new experience - sometimes with the unctuous liver coming to the forefront and at other times with the truffle perfumed potatoes taking center stage.  Though not my favorite dish of the meal, a single bite - foie, daikon, potato, truffle, parmesan - would be the perfect way to describe Robuchon's cuisine...multiple exotic yet restrained flavors coming together to form something entirely original and perfect.\n\nThe next course would be the third of four foie gras dishes for the evening.  Titled LE FOIE GRAS frais de canard cuit au torchon this version would be much more simplistic yet even better than the prior manifestation.  For $36 the traditionally poached chilled duck foie gras was delivered as a torchon accompanied by a dusting of espelette and topped with sea salt and cracked black pepper.  Sourced from the Gascony region of France the Foie was sweeter than I expected, though not artificially so.  Arriving with a plate of grilled country bread I imagine this dish took me ~20-25 minutes to eat as I savored each bite.\n\nLA LANGOUSTINE dans une papillote croustillante au basilica, or Crispy langoustine fritter with basil pesto featured a single Langoustine, sweet and perfect, wrapped in a leaf of basil and flash fried in a batter so thin it was transparent.  With the slight crackle of the shell giving way to sweet and snappy shellfish the effect was tremendous alone and better with the streaks of citrus and garlic pesto on the plate.  At $22 the price point is certainly not for everyone and if I had to eat Langoustine in Vegas I'd go to Twist first, but I was glad to have experienced this.\n\nL'OEUF cocotte et sa cr\u00e8me l\u00e9g\u00e8re de champignons.  At $19 this is another relatively famous L'Atelier dish.  Featuring a farm fresh egg steamed until barely firm I watched the dish next covered in saut\u00e9ed mushrooms by one chef while another whipped a foamy broth of cream, mushroom broth, and butter which was subsequently poured over the mushrooms.  Finally topped with salt, pepper, and chili powder the final presentation was visual foam with specks of pepper while beneath lied another perfect balance of ingredients.  Smooth and creamy egg, fibrous mushroom, plenty of butter - yet light as a cloud.\n\nThe next course would be a revelation - the sort of dish that on paper seems so simple yet in execution makes you realize why you even go to places like L'Atelier in the first place.  LE RIS DE VEAU clout\u00e9 de laurier frais \u00e0 la feuille de romaine farcie featured a single sweetbread-the largest I've ever seen at nearly the size of a tennis balll - pierced with a bay leaf and pan seared in butter, herbs, and veal jus before being paired on the plate with saut\u00e9ed romaine lettuce in a faintly garlic and dill foam.  At $29 the offal itself cut easily with nothing but a fork and at 5-6 mouthfuls were the best tastes of the meal-almost caramelized on the exterior and creamy within.  A fan of elaborate dishes it is plates like this that remind me just how exquisite simplicity can be when done right.\n\nMy final bites from L'Atelier would be another classic dish and the only one seemingly served at each and every L'Atelier-LA CAILLE au foie gras, caram\u00e9lis\u00e9e avec une pomme pur\u00e9e truff\u00e9e.  At $28 the portion was certainly small, but the impact of the caramelized foie gras stuffed free-range quail with Robuchon's famous truffled-mashed potatoes is undeniable-the whole plate is simply decadence defined.  Somewhat unbalanced compared to the other dishes I will note that the crispy quail was quite mild compared to the creamy liver, but obviously it's not like I mind the flavor of foie gras.  The potatoes - there really isn't anything else that can be said...having had the buttered version last year all I can say is that the truffles make them even better.\n\nOutstanding service and a true experience to watch the kitchen I'd definitely head back for a couple courses regularly if I lived locally, and of course to see what Chef Guechida was doing pastry side.", "business_id": "4uGHPY-OpJN08CabtTAvNg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-02", "type": "review"}

Served curled around the cr\u00e8me fraiche the salmon was excellent - more firm than a sashimi prep, but similar in taste.  With the caviar somewhat less briny than others I've tasted it worked well with the somewhat sour cr\u00e8me while the egg added its characteristic creamy flavor.  The Potato soup was a commendable potage - the creamy texture balanced nicely with the onions and chives.\n\nWith myself ordering the 5-course degustation, largely unchanged over many years at Picasso, and Erika opting to go Prix Fixe for more choices our first courses would arrive simultaneously.  For my first dish, Maine Lobster Salad - Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette was ample in portion, elegant in presentation, and lovely on the palate.  With thick chunks of chilled lobster in a light cream sauce serving as the base, the \"salad\" was essentially microgreens tossed with apple-cider accented vinaigrette atop.  Flanked by melon balls and tomatoes of varying colors the dish was quite light, a wonderful opening volley even if it was much more \"lobster\" than \"salad.\"\n\nCourse two was a Pan Seared U-10 Day Boat Scallop with Potato Mousseline and Jus de Veau.  Served with a potato crisp standing playfully behind the single monstrous scallop the dish looked beautiful and the tastes were lovely, albeit predictable with the savory veal reduction balancing the sweet scallop.  With the creamy potato puree loaded with butter the place where this dish missed was in the centerpiece - gorgeously caramelized to the point of a near brulee on the exterior the scallop was simply a bit too well done at its center.  While certainly a competent and lovely preparation the fact remains that perhaps twenty less seconds on the pan could have elevated it to a whole different level.\n\nThe next course would provide my sister with an empty charger while I would receive the Saut\u00e9ed \"A\" Steak of Foie Gras with Poached Pears, Huckleberries, Crushed Pistachios, Lemon Zest, and Rhubarb.  A large steak of 3-4 ounces of high quality and perfectly cleaned Foie Gras, the liver itself was everything you would expect.  Placed atop a \"cake\" of compressed pistachio and topped with roasted crunchy pistachios kissed with lemon the textures were a nice contrast and exceptionally complimentary.  Swirled with rhubarb reduction and plated alongside a poached pear with huckleberries this dish did not attempt to reinvent the wheel, but it was quite memorable for its classic approach.\n\nThe main course was Roasted Lamb Chops with Sweet Bell Pepper Farci turned out to be quite the substantial portion - easily 7-8oz including the bone.  Prepared rare and extremely juicy yet easily cut with the side of the fork this was without a doubt a top-5 all time lamb preparation.  Presented simply with rosemary, a stack of buttery potatoes, and a m\u00e9lange of sweet bell peppers this would prove my favorite dish of the evening, regardless of how good the Foie Gras was.\n\nHazelnut and Coffee Opera with Coffee Hazelnut Ice Cream and Brown Sugar Filberts was quite impressive in presentation.  With a thin wedge of moist cake served on edge with a \"shadow\" of Hazelnut dust the flavor and texture of the cake was somewhere between almond dacquoise and tiramisu.  Resting happily next to the tall and proud cake, a small ball of similarly flavored ice cream atop candied nuts - creamy and crunchy, a nice cake and ice cream combination but certainly nothing to write home about.\n\nMaking our way from Picasso I must say I left with mixed emotions - not because anything was bad - as a matter of fact, everything was quite good.  The issue was that aside from a lovely Christmas Eve with my little sister at a restaurant that seemed unattainable a mere 8 years ago, nothing was \"great\" aside from the d\u00e9cor and art.  In the end I think Picasso has maintained its place in the Vegas culinary scene - it is just that many other restaurants, and my own personal dining preferences, have perhaps grown to be something more.", "business_id": "-5RN56jH78MV2oquLV_G8g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-27", "type": "review"}

Otherwise what's the point of travelling if you don't try to experience some of the local culture and cuisine. I was therefore excited to find a fine dining restaurant offering local native Indian cuisine rather than the ubiquitous tex mex of the southwest.\n\nWell, I enjoyed one of the best dining experiences of my life here, not just best native Indian dining experience.\n\nThe restaurant is located on the Wild Horse Resort complex, which is a native Indian resort offering casino & golf as well as hotel facilities. My only problem was navigating the huge complex and my only criticism was that the signposting to the hotel/restaurant was poor, something which I mentioned to the staff and received a promise that the problem had already been identified and was being dealt with. Just in case it still hasn't, head for the golf clubhouse and keep going beyond that despite the lack of signage!\n\nThere is valet parking available but self parking is no problem. The hotel itself is spacious and Kai is located on the ground floor. Kai is the Pima word for seed and there are many obvious native Indian influences, reflected in many aspects of  the design and architecture - this is all explained in the restaurant menu and is obviously an aspect of the experience that they're very rightly proud of here.\n\nThe restaurant has been recently refurbished to a very high standard. The tables are well spaced out and everything reeks of top quality - for example, the menus are printed on embossed paper.\n\nI think the way to sum up this amazing restaurant is 'attention to detail'. I've been lucky to dine in 3 Michelin star establishments but nowhere in the whole world I've visited beats Kai for attention to detail. Everyone knew my name from my reservation. Cutlery restocked from different sides of the table. New napkins for every visit to the restroom. Crockery and cutlery warmed or chilled to appropriate temperature for every dish!!\n\nThe service is also friendly and very informative. There is also great drama with the food and choreography to the service. Foie gras is bruleed at the tableside. Soups are decanted into bowls from pitchers. Multiple waiters coordinate simultaneous delivery of dishes to multiple diner tables.\n\nMy server kindly arranged a fresh orange juice. Then came another moment which sums up this amazing restaurant - I was offered fruit accompaniments with my glass of regular water!\n\nOnto the food.  I went for the tasting menu with its interesting choice of ingedients and combinations. \n\nI was pleased to see that the choice of breads included local Indian flatbread - a local Indian chief came into the kitchen to show the chefs how to make it. This was served with a first rate fruity olive oil.\n\n1. Amuse of buffalo tartare with cornbread crisp, crisp microgreens and balsamic vinegar. The buffalo was more gamey than normal beef and the balsamic vinegar was an excellent foil.\n\n2. Avocado panna cota toped with shrimp ceviche. The server poured over a papaya and mango soup at the table. My first huge smile moment when I found my chilled spoon! This was a dish which intrigued me from its unlikely combination of such disparate ingredients and it worked!! The smooth avocado was a perfect base for the tangy ceviche and the fruit soup wasn't too sweet but the subtleties of the papaya and mango were definitely evident flavours.\n\n3. For a carnivore, I was amazed at the great salad which followed -  the menu told me that the lettuces had been picked by local farmers and children of the Gila Crossing School. The salad had a chilli dressing. It was accompanied by date cake with foie gras (yum!), Humboult Fog goat cheese and heirloom tomato with candied walnut.\n\n4. Baja scallop topped with dried mango and sandalwood dust. The sandalwood gave the dish a powerful aromatic introduction, which activated all my salivary glands. An unusual use of what is usually used in incense sticks. The giant sweet scallop was served with bean puree, fried salsify and fennel pollen.\n\n5. Seared foie gras with macerated huckleberry and a fig in filo pastry. If you've read my other reviews, you'll know that you can't go wrong with seared foie gras with me!\n\n6. Palate cleanser of guava with fennel sorbet and mango sauce.\n\n7. Grilled tenderloin of buffalo from the Cheyenne River Tribe. The meat was open and evenly textured, tender with a nice gamey flavour. The plate was completed with a chorizo and corn cake and a morel mushroom mix.\n\n8. Lamb with pecan crust with chocolate and chilli sauce. Chocoalte with chilli has become mainstream and I wonder if this is where it originated.\n\n9. Cheese. Belgian soft cheese and a Tasmanian cheddar.\n\n10. Medley of desserts. Corn creme brulee. Fig bread with chocolate ice cream inside. Italian meringue bruleed tableside with fruit.\n\nAlso lovely to chat to chef de cuisine Jack Strong after the meal.", "business_id": "T9iBSa4pxYXP129pHlt5Sg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-03-21", "type": "review"}

Figured maybe I was early for the HH pricing or had missed fine print somewhere. Order was out quick via drive thru.\n\nAnd when I pulled up at home I realized the mistake. Somehow my order was doubled to two of each of the two tortilla rolls, and a nacho wrap was thrown in. A little frustrating, since that now made a gigantic amount of food instead of a snack, and I hate wasting.\n\nBut then I tried the food. And the nacho wrap was about the only thing that was edible. The tortilla rolls were two different types: a chipotle chicken flavor that was somehow just a couple of grilled chicken pieces and a ton of sour cream, then a chili cheese fry flavor that had spicy chili in an amount that seemed like it was trying to cover up the fact that the potatoes were burned. And oh yeah, there was no cheese. Weird.\n\nThe Baja Blast was just meh. I'm not a caffeine fan and for some reason I thought this drink was more of an Icee/Slurpee, but it's just a flavored Mountain Dew. \n\nEven with the order being butchered and the food being subpar, I didn't expect my stomach to hurt afterward.

With some orders having been phoned in and others being delivered to the tables surrounding mine if I had to guess nearly fifteen Fry Breads were served during my nine minute wait and when I finally heard \"Michael\" called from the front I stepped up to collect my $12 merely seconds before the next order was served up to \"Andre.\"\n\nReturning to my seat with prizes in hand my first impression was that I'd over ordered as each disc was easily the size of a Frisbee and two-to-three fold as thick, but picking up my first option, the \"Indian Taco with Pinto Beans, Shredded Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce\" I was next impressed as to just how light the hand stretched bread was - a wisp of pillowy flat bread crisped on the outside by the oil but light and airy within.  With the ingredients a standard store-bought admixture of traditional taco toppings and a bit of hot sauce to taste this was a good choice to understand what the \"Indian Taco\" was all about (and perhaps to understand why diabetes and lipid disorders are so prevalent in their population, as well.)\n\nMoving next to my dessert selection, one of the frequently noted \"best dishes\" in Phoenix and denoted as an \"Award Winning Favorite\" on the restaurant menu, the Chocolate and Butter Fry Bread would prove to be every bit the \"Fair Food\" extravagance I expected with the same airy dough this time served openfaced and drizzled - nay - ladled first with butter and then with melted dark chocolate tinged with what I believe was adobe spice and cinnamon.  Sliced and resting atop both wax paper and napkins to soak up the grease I attacked this fry bread with zeal and without going so far as to call it the most sinful thing I've eaten this year I will simply say this; it was a once-in-a-year sort of treat that was entirely worth the money, calories, and visit but at the same time the sort of thing that simply feels \"bad\" for you despite the smile on your face as you're eating it.", "business_id": "mqQwChPNN4o4DhAzaGntIA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-14", "type": "review"}

If I wanted my eggs spicy- I would have ordered them that way. I wished my Eggs Benedict had come looking like the picture that is posted on Yelp. And those potatoes? Eh. Not so good. \n\nThe people next to me ordered pancakes and bacon and had there been a contest- those would have been the big winner, for sure! \n\nBreakfast and an espresso ran about $18. There is plenty of parking in the lot or on the street. If you go- and want stellar service- sit at the coffee bar and have Eli take care of you. \n\nGreat service from Eli. Friendly and accommodating host staff. But the food? I felt for a moment that I was in detention at the Breakfast Club.

So if you are planning to eat at a nice restaurant in Vegas, you are probably not going to get your money's worth.  Still, the quality varies quite a bit.  Mesa Grill and Carnevino are both overpriced, but at least their food is good (at least on my visits).  There are other Vegas restaurants where you spend a lot and the food is bad (or mostly bad).  Fin is one of those restaurants.\n\nFin sits in The Mirage and has a contemporary decor that is nice though it does not really stand out.  The restaurant is very close to the casino, but it is still pretty quiet.\n\nFin is a Chinese restaurant, but it is probably a more Americanized interpretation (based on what we had here).  They were doing a $40 3-course special.  There was a good variety of starters to choose from while there was not much selection among the entrees or the desserts.  We all opted for the 3-course.  We added some a la carte dishes to share as well.\n\nI started with the barbecued spare ribs.  They were sweet but not overly sweet.  The ribs could have used something else to give them a little more kick.  The meat did not have a fall-off-the-bone texture.  The meat was not exactly tough, but it could have been more tender.\n\nI did not try the shrimp and scallop wraps, but they looked bland.  I tried the crispy shrimp toast that was served on a sweet and sour sauce.  That starter was decent.\n\nFor my entree, I opted for the Chilean Sea Bass that was served over a sweet garlic sauce.  The sea bass came with a side of steamed white rice.  The sea bass was fried (the menu said wok fried, but it seemed to be more deep fried).  The sea bass was quite greasy.  It was also incredibly fishy, which was a little odd because sea bass typically does not have one of the stronger fish tastes.  It could have been because it was not that fresh or simply that the fish flavor became more pronounced in how they fried it.\n\nI really did not like the fish.  The greasiness and the taste made me feel a little queasy and I can eat pretty much anything.\n\nFrom the a la carte menu, we had the General Tsao's Chicken, which was served with broccoli.  This dish was pretty good.  The chicken was juicy and tasty while the sauce was both sweet and with some good heat.\n\nWe also had Shrimp Lo Mein noodles, which were okay.  The noodles were fine and seasoned properly.  The shrimp was plump; however, they were not cooked long enough.\n\nFor dessert, I opted for the assorted sorbet, which had 3 flavors.  There was lychee and blood orange.  I cannot remember the other flavor.  Only the blood orange had a good flavor.  The other two flavors were bland.\n\nThe sorbet here was all ice.  It was like eating a really frozen slushie.\n\nThe other dessert option was a vanilla creme brulee and it was much better.  The vanilla custard was smooth, creamy and had a good vanilla flavor.  There was a nice caramelized shell.  The creme brulee was garnished with fresh berries.\n\nThey finished us off with a complimentary Baileys shot, which was good, and a fortune cookie.  The fortune cookie was pretty good.  It was a little thicker and more buttery than most fortune cookies I've had.  The messages seemed homemade especially since the paper appeared to be cut with scissors.\n\nService was not that good.  I have heard that strong customer service is not a high priority at Chinese restaurants (more emphasis is placed on flavors and value).  Maybe this place was trying to emulate that even though it seemed to be an Americanized Chinese restaurant.  The waiter seemed confused and he left the table when we were ordering to check up on another table.  Other servers seemed a little bit abrupt.\n\nStill, once we put the order in, the food did come out at a good and organized pace.\n\nOf the \"nice\" Las Vegas restaurants I have tried, Fin may be the worst one.  The General Tsao's Chicken and creme brulee were both good.  For the other dishes we had though, I think you would be able to get just as good food (if not better food) at one of the P.F. Chang's nearby (and at a much lower price).  There are many Vegas restaurants to avoid and Fin would definitely be among them.\n\nThe Mirage has complimentary parking (both valet and a parking structure).", "business_id": "jOgSvW9VNw0Cw9p8w5A2JQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-03-15", "type": "review"}

I fell in love with them on the West Coast, then found myself going less and less when we got locations back in my hometown in Texas.

Score! Need to keep this place in mind when I need flowers.\n\nProduce can be very hit or miss, I find them to be pretty overpriced.\nFrozen section has a lot of scores for people who don't really know how to cook, or who want some help for their side dishes: their chicken potstickers are a steal at $3/bag, and they're super easy to heat and eat. They also have a chicken gorgonzola dish that is pretty bomb.\n\nRecently they've added a fresh juice section- today I grabbed a bottle of carrot juice, also available in organic for about a buck more. I may have to go back and stock up.\n\nLots of snackable foods in the rest of the store, from cracker-cut cheeses and goat cheese samplers in dairy, to more varieties of tortilla and pita chips than you can shake a stick at (including the pumpkin seed and cranberry variety that I love!). Refrigerated cases have just about every hummus under the sun (eggplant is my favorite), and of course there's the wine section as well.\n\nTJ's three buck Chuck in the Cab is good, but I don't think I've ever gone wrong blindly picking from the aisles either. There's a sparkling red that's good too, I think it's by Romano vinyards? No clue, but it's delish and $5, which might narrow down your search. It has a champagne-type cork and is on the last aisle by the chips.\n\nService is stellar, too.

I learned of the Grotto by accident really - I was busy sipping glasses of wine and attempting to order bar food, only to learn that bar food was a delicious array of Italian fare.\n\nPerhaps it was the alcohol doing the talking for me, because everything I had was inhaled in minutes.  The Montel Wrap, a parmesan crusted Chilean sea bass married with roma tomatoes and lettuce was better drunk food than the burger and fries I was initially fantasizing about.  Another winner was the lasagna and the margherita pizza was deceivingly tasty.  I managed to go back to my hotel room in a pseudo drunken food coma, a condition best experienced in Vegas.\n\nI decided to come back during another night for dinner, this time sober and just as hungry.  Having witnessed the dining room for the first time, I realized it was easy to miss this place.  The Grotto doesn't stand out and the tacky decor wasn't going to win any awards either.  When examining a menu for a second time, it was clear Grotto's was a Italiana Americana restaurant, more than it was anything more authentic.\n\nService was good, almost too good for a downtown casino establishment.  They were courteous, professional, and prompt with everything.  I had a stellar recommendation in the very tasty ($9) lobster bisque, not too fishy and just a tad of creme.  Another solid dish was the linguine pescatore, but felt overpriced at $27 for a medium portion.  I also was able to try their herb crusted pork loin ($25), juicy and hearty, with a nice seared crust, had a nice flavor with it.  The yukon mashed potatoes were a nice touch but tasted like they were whipped with butter and sour cream.\n\nFinally our table of hungry hippos decided it would be a good idea to order the sausage and peppers pizza.  The crust was a little charred, too much to a point where it was dry and mediocre.  I would give this another shot, especially since I've heard more former colleagues rave about this pizza than any other entree on their menu.\n\nThe Golden Nugget has a mini gem here with Grotto.

It has a collection of shops that are unrivaled in such a small space.\n\n- The number of food options allows for any diet or preference.\n\n- They've remodeled many of the old rooms and have built a new tower.  They've been able to stay relevant by doing so.\n\n- They have some great nightlife options.  Pure is their anchor nightclub.\n\n- The location in the center of the Strip allows you to wander around Vegas and experience both the old and new side of Vegas.\n\nThis is a must see property for our out of town guests.  They've never left disappointed.  I enjoy coming down and shopping at the Forum Shops, which I do 5-6 times a year.\n\nWill I return?  There's no doubt about it!", "business_id": "z3SyT8blMIhsZNvKJgKcRA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-23", "type": "review"}

I love the service here better. They do not rush you. The cook is awesome. The food is freshly prepared and everything is so reasonably priced. A great perk, it's like $4.99 or something like that for a chicken bowl and a drink. You can't find that these days. Oh yeah, but before I forget to mention, that deal is only valid if you have a student ID. I was happy. They accepted my ID from work, since I work at a school. I guess it almost makes me a student huh. Anyways, I love the adobo fried rice and the pork adobo plate was tasty. I was like WHOA!! That's a lot of food. Even with friends helping to munch on everything, we didn't finish our meal. The OX Tail soup wasn't available so we weren't happy about that but the food we did order was bomb. I know some locals don't like this place too much but this is a treat for us, since all we have is the usual L&L type stuff. This is the spot when we come to vegas.

Both the WONTON SOUP and the HOUSE SEAFOOD NOODLE SOUP are good picks.\n\nBEEF STEW is hearty and delicious, and the gravy had undertones of flavor that were reminiscent of pho. Not sure if they include bone broth in the gravy or if it's a particular aromatic, but the gravy had good flavor and the meat was tender.\nSTEAMED CHICKEN WITH MUSHROOMS AND SAUSAGE is a solid, filling dish, served with rice and greens.

Some dishes are gussied up with contemporary cooking techniques or high end ingredients while other dishes veer more on the fusion side.  \n\nI started with one of their tacos--a carnitas one topped with guacamole, fresh lime and chicarrones.  I thought the fillings were great.  The carnitas was moist and tender.  It was also nicely seasoned.  It had a good flavor and wasn't too salty (which happens a lot with carnitas).  The guacamole was cool and refreshing and it was a great contrast to the warm and savory carnitas.\n\nThe chicarrones were crispy and light.  The soft corn tortilla was fine, but it wasn't a good vessel for the meat juices.  The only problem with the taco was that it was too wet.\n\nI also has the twenty vegetable fried rice and it was very good.  The rice had a nice soy flavor, but it was not too salty.  The vegetables provided great contrasts in textures, but with that many vegetables, which were cut up into small pieces as well as paired with a flavorful rice, the individual flavors of the vegetables were (as expected) kind of lost.\n\nStill, there were a lot of vegetables including fresh greens, crispy sweet potato, haricot verts, squash, turnips, carrots, asparagus, Brussels sprouts, and watermelon radish.  There were also proteins like soft tofu and scambled egg.\n\nFor dessert, I opted for their flan and it was very good.  The flan was incredibly smooth, creamy and light like a panna cotta.  It was topped with a great cajeta gelee (rich caramel flavor).  There was also cajeta ice cream (incredibly dense and a great rich caramel flavor).  The plate was garnished with good pineapple, which was not too tart.\n\nService by the bartender Victor was excellent; he was incredibly personal and helpful with the menu.  You could tell he really wanted all of his customers to have the best experience possible.\n\nPrices are not too bad considering that it was Vegas.  The fried rice dish was under $20 and it was a very generous portion.  Some portion sizes seem small in a few dishes when considering the prices (like the tacos), but it is still a better value than the many overpriced Vegas restaurants serving just so-so food.\n\nIn terms of the decor at China Poblano, the bar gives you a view of the chefs making the dim sum.  There is a main dining room, but I wasn't a fan of the tables (they kind of looked like what you would find at a gourmet order-at-the-counter spot).  Overall, the decor was forgettable and not that great.\n\nI thought the food at China Poblano was good.  The food was pricey, but Vegas food tends to be pricey and there are places in Vegas serving much more expensive food that is not nearly as tasty or refined as what you can get at China Poblano.  I think China Poblano is a good spot for an upscale lunch.  And since the same menu (with the same prices) is featured at dinner, it is a good spot for a nice dinner with a more casual approach and more reasonable prices than the many overpriced high-end dinner places in Las Vegas.\n\nI believe the Cosmopolitan offers both complimentary valet and self parking.", "business_id": "cMvN1j-LK64zqmT4vnl8NA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-09-23", "type": "review"}

Since I was only doing takeout, I just made the cut for the lunch specials from 11AM-3PM (also valid on weekends!) and opted for the garlic chicken. \n\nPer the menu, lunch specials come with soup (when you dine in), salad, fried rice, and egg roll (I thought this was a Thai place?), with entr\u00e9e protein choice of chicken, beef, or pork,  surcharge for shrimp. My dish was  one flavorless spring roll, a heap of wonton strips (who eats those except on soup?), and a chunk of ice berg lettuce with some matchstick carrots. And my (half?) portion of garlic chicken: lightly flavored sauce, tender chicken, and a good shake of pepper on top? Very odd. Oh and the \"entr\u00e9e\" section of the takeout box was largely dominated by a gigantic heap of white rice. Not fried. This would be better placed where the wonton strips are.\n\nService was quick and polite. Order did not meet my expectations. Did not eat half the order: won ton strips and dressing-less lettuce were tossed, could not stomach the flavorless spring roll or more than a few bites of the white rice that was hogging the space that should have been occupied by more garlic chicken.\nLikely would not come here again.", "business_id": "QFmcDvpO1qLbSMtmddxF2Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-10-11", "type": "review"}

And then the parking lot in front is a dead-end, so you end up having to pull back in then back out again to leave.\n\nBut if you're seeking this place out, it's for their product, not their parking lot.\nSmoothies and wraps sound good to me, but even perusing their menu online showed me that their prices were a little ridiculous- wouldn't go back without a Groupon, that's for sure.\n\nIt's interesting to view their changing prices via the pictures here on Yelp- less than a year ago they were $2 less for a drink or a wrap. Produce prices haven't gone up so far to justify that, but whatever.\n\nI ultimately got a 24oz Jungle Storm smoothie- their Groupon deals are available in $10 denominations, but when I asked what I could add to my order, they didn't really have an answer. I thought I'd grab a raw dessert from the refrigerated case, but when i realized it was $5 for a cinnamon \"bun\" that was about the size of a can-lid, I declined and did a coconut water instead.\n\nBoth drinks were served in plastic cups with plastic lids and a straw. The coconut water was literally poured out of a jug and into my cup. The smoothie was okay though- but nothing special.\n\nI get the feeling this place is only in business because they are adjacent to a yoga studio, but even so I'm pretty sure the only reason their prices are so high is to turn a profit- they don't seem to get much other traffic.\n\nAs an additional note, there were five employees present. And none of them were smiling, happy, or friendly. \n\nOn the bright side, despite the odd exterior, the inside of the restaurant is nicely decorated and has a giant, decorated tree in the middle- the tables and chairs are nice, appear carefully-selected, and there is a lot of room to dine in if you choose to do so.", "business_id": "bsIG-bXSRcCx62k4lHBEcw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-02-12", "type": "review"}

Specials include a $10 prime rib and shrimp, $5 steak and eggs or ham and eggs, and a few others- BF preferred the prime rib dinner, which did not have shrimp but came in a larger size with soup or salad, rolls, vegetable of the day, and choice of potato. I tried his meat and it was actually surprisingly good, as was the au jus, which I usually find too salty.\n\nI opted for the Wednesday dinner special of roasted pork loin with mashed potatoes and pan gravy with the same sides as above- meat was actually surprisingly good, but could have used a smidge more gravy. I liked the potatoes and I'm usually a little picky about them- slightly salty, seemed to me bad with smashed baby reds which are my favorite. Vegetable of the day was canned corn, which was lackluster and mostly flavorless. \n\nFInal note about the side salads that we started with: in addition to being rather large, they're drenched in dressing- so if you're counting calories you really should ask for it on the side. That being said, lettuce and other vegetables were crisp and fresh.\n\nService was a little less than impressive: took our server a good 10 minutes to approach us for the first time, he was a bit short with us, and when I asked for a cup of chili he snapped at me and said it only came in a bowl portion.
